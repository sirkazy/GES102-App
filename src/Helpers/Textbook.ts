          title: "Introduction",
          content: `The efforts to reconstruct the human past may be classified into 
          two, namely; prehistory, which refers to the period before written 
          history and, history, which covers the era after the invention of 
          writing enabled human communities to record and store 
          information.The prehistoric period is important, not only by 
          reason of its vast length, but also because during this time humans 
          made almost all their major discoveries and adaptations to 
          environment and group life (except those connected with the recent 
          ICT age) and evolved physically into our living species and its 
          races. The main body of material upon which our understanding of 
          the prehistoric period of human existence is based therefore 
          comprises: first, remains left by early humans largely in form of 
          tools, artifacts and animal bones found by archaeological 
          excavation in old habitation sites; secondly, other traces of their 
          activities, such as buildings and rock-carving or rock painting; and 
          lastly, the bones of the early humans themselves. These materials 
          give credible evidence of their social, intellectual and religious life.`

          greatly in different parts of the world. Archaeological investigation 
          of the material remains of prehistoric or early humans has shown 
          that a variety of cultures flourished in different parts of the world 
          and at different times. These have been grouped into a series of 
          major cultures based primarily on the nature of the principal tool or 
          material used for implements, and sometimes on the techniques 
          used in fashioning these implements. In the absence of fixed dates, 
          these cultures have usually been divided into the following series 
          of periods or age, beginning with the oldest:

          title: "Humans as Primates",
          content: `Humans are primates, that is, the highest order of mammals. 
          Physical and genetic similarities show that the modern human 
          species, that is, Homo sapiens, has a very close relationship to 
          another group of primate species; the Apes. Humans and the great 
          apes (large apes) of Africa – Chimpanzees and gorillas – are 
          believed to share a common ancestor, the Australopithecus, which 
          lived between six and eight million years ago. However, human 
          beings clearly stand out as the most distinctive of the primate 
          species. Variations in genetic makeup and body chemistry have led 
          to enormous differences in levels of intelligence and ability to 
          exercise control over the natural world. Humans developed an 
          extraordinary high order of intelligence which enabled them to 
          devise tools, technologies, language skills and other means of 
          communication and cooperation. Whereas other animal species 
          adapted physically and genetically to their environment, human 
          beings altered the natural environment to suit their own needs and 
          desires.`

          title: "Early Humans in Africa",
          content: `The place of origin of humans is still uncertain. The old theory of 
          Central Asia as the ‘cradle of mankind’ was based on false 
          premises, which have been abandoned. From the living and fossil 
          great apes, australopithecines, and humans, it is thought that 
          Africa and the Early Humans 3
          humans first evolved in Africa, and that the divergence of humans 
          from the general anthropoid stem probably occurred in Africa. The 
          idea that humans evolved in Africa can be traced to Charles 
          Darwin. In his 1871 book, The Descent of Man, Darwin speculated 
          that it was probable that Africa was the cradle of humans, because 
          their closest living relatives – Chimpanzees and gorillas – live 
          there. Although, it is impossible to answer all the questions raised 
          on the origins of human beings, the paleontological records 
          brought to light in the last 150 years provide the basis for an 
          evolutionary theory which appears to be fairly established. 
          Archaeological discoveries in South Africa by Prof. Raymond Dart 
          and Dr. L.S.B. Leaky and his wife Mary Leaky in East Africa have 
          reawakened the speculation that Africa was the probable birthplace 
          of Man. Through these discoveries it has been possible to trace a 
          conceivable evolution of Man from Australopithecus through 
          Homo erectus to Homo sapiens. For our purpose in this chapter, 
          the history of humans began at the moment when they were able to 
          fashion their first stone tools that can be unmistakably recognised 
          to be of human workmanship.`

              title: "Australopithecus (the Southern Ape)",
              content: `Archaeological discoveries in Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia 
          and other places have revealed bones and tools of human 
          ancestors going back about four to five million years. The 
          Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and Hadar in Ethiopia have 
          yielded especially rich remains of human species. These 
          finds represented several species of the oldest hominids 
          belonging to the genus Australopithecus (the Southern 
          Ape), believed to have flourished in East Africa about four 
          million years ago before spreading throughout the 
          continent. Compared to other apes, Australopithecines were 
          believed to be sophisticated creatures. They were bipeds, 
          that is, they walked upright on two legs, which enabled 
          them to use their arms independently for other tasks. They 
          had well-developed hands with opposable thumbs, which 
          enabled them to grasp tools and perform intricate 
          4 D.O. Ajayi
          operations. Paleontologists also believed that they probably 
          had some ability to communicate verbally, although 
          analysis of their skulls suggests that the portion of the brain 
          responsible for speech was not very large or well￾developed. Australopithecus comprised of two species, 
          namely;
          (i) Australopithecus Africanus – slender, chimpanzee￾sized and omnivorous.
          (ii) Australopithecus Robustus – size of gorilla, with 
          large teeth and subsisted mainly on vegetarian diet. 
          The intelligence of the Australopithecus was sufficient to 
          allow them to plan complex ventures. They often travelled 
          deliberately over distance of up to fifteen kilometers 
          (9.3 miles) and more to obtain the particular kinds of stone 
          that they needed to fashion tools. These tools included 
          choppers, scrapers and other implements for food 
          preparation. With the aid of their tools and intelligence, 
          Australopithecines established themselves securely 
          throughout most eastern and southern Africa.`

              title: "Homo Habilis (Handy Man)",
              content: `From about 2 million years ago, a group of Hominids lived 
          in eastern and southern Africa at the same time as 
          Australopithecines. They are called Homo habilis, whose 
          remains were found in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya and 
          South Africa. The individuals in this group stood out from 
          the Australopithecines for their bigger brain and the traces 
          they left of a rudimental civilisation. In addition to the 
          remains, hand-worked pebbles have been found chipped 
          along the margin of one or both sides (chopper and 
          chopping tools). They are the earliest evidence of 
          intentional stone carving which appears to express a level 
          of intellect corresponding to that of human beings.`

              title: "Homo Erectus (Upright Walking Man)",
              content: `As early as 1.6 million years ago in Africa, life forms 
          having higher cranial capacity evolved and displaced their 
          Africa and the Early Humans 5
          predecessors. The new species represented creatures 
          considerably different from the Australopithecines. Most 
          important of them was Homo erectus, believed to have 
          flourished in East, South and West Africa. The culture of 
          Homo erectus attests to an unmistakable human level, and 
          their civilisation proved more advanced: bifacial industries, 
          pebble carving, cleavers and hand axes and stone chipping. 
          Bifacial tools and splinters, show intentional shaping aimed 
          at a given plan. Similarly, splinter fashioning gives 
          evidence to the will to improve on the functionality of the 
          tools. The presence of Homo erectus was believed to have 
          coincided with the domestic use of fire, which furnished the 
          species with a means to cook food, a defence against large 
          animals and a source of artificial heat. Even more important 
          than tools and fire were intelligence and language skills. 
          Paleontologists and archaeologists have determined that 
          bands of Homo erectus men conducted their hunts in well￾coordinated ways that presumed prior communication. 
          Regarding the economy, Homo erectus relied on hunting 
          and gathering as throughout all the Paleolithic period. With 
          effective tools, fire, intelligence and language, Homo 
          erectus gained increasing control over the natural 
          environment and introduced the human species into widely 
          scattered regions. Whereas Australopithecines had not 
          ventured beyond eastern and southern Africa, Homo 
          erectus, it was believed, migrated to North Africa, Asia and 
          Europe.`

              title: "Homo Sapiens (Consciously Thinking Human)",
              content: `Like its predecessor, Homo erectus faded with the arrival of 
          more intelligent and successful human species, Homo 
          sapiens. This transition is believed to have taken place 
          between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. In those times, 
          Homo sapiens was fully evolved, and had differentiated 
          into the various sub-species regarded as the five or six main 
          races of mankind. Other species of Homo not directly 
          ancestral to Homo sapiens, the Neanderthal men, were 
          uncovered in Europe dating form upper Paleolithic. The 
          Neanderthal man, whose fossils were found in the Neander 
          Valley of Germany in 1856, became extinct about 10,000 
          years ago. However, human remains dating from about 
          90,000 years ago, found in Palestine, descending from the 
          African forms of Homo have been recognised as evidence 
          of the origins of the Homo sapiens species, that is, present 
          day human beings. Homo sapiens was believed to possess a 
          large brain. This physical feature provided Homo sapiens
          with an enormous advantage, which earlier species lacked. 
          Although not endowed with great strength and not 
          equipped with natural means of attack and defence, such as, 
          claws, beaks, fangs, shells, venom and the like, 
          paleontological evidence suggests that Homo sapiens
          possessed a remarkable intelligence that provided a 
          powerful edge in the contest for survival. Intelligence 
          enabled Homo sapiens to adapt to widely varying 
          environmental conditions and to establish the species 
          securely throughout the world. Beginning more than 
          100,000 years ago, communities of Homo sapiens spread

          The principal characteristic of the Paleolithic era was that human 
          beings foraged for their food: they hunted wild animals and 
          gathered edible plants. Men travelled on sometimes distant hunting 
          expeditions in search of animals, while women and children 
          gathered edible plants, roots, nuts and fruits. Hunting and 
          gathering, peoples did not just wander aimlessly about hoping to 
          find food. Rather, they exploited the environment systematically 
          and effectively by timing their movements to coincide with the 
          seasonal migrations of the animals they hunted and the plant 
          species they gathered. Meat from hunt was the most highly prized 
          item in the Paleolithic diet, but plant foods were essential for 
          survival. Apart from supplying meat, the bones of the animals 
          served as tools, skins for clothing and shelter, leather bags for 
          gathering, water jugs and rubber strings for hunting and for 
          carrying babies. Early humans fashioned special tools such as 
          sharp knives, spears and bows and arrows, and devised special 
          tactics for hunting large animals such as, elephants, rhinoceros, 
          antelopes, buffaloes, and wild cattle.

          content : `The hunters wore disguises 
          such as, animal skins and coordinated their movements so as to 
          attack a game simultaneously from different directions. They 
          sometimes even started fires or caused disturbances to drive herds 
          into swamps or enclosed areas where hunters could kill them more 
          easily. Gathering was mostly done by women and children who 
          used digging sticks and carrying leather bags. They collected a 
          variety of large nuts, fruits, edible roots and tubers. Gathering 
          accounted for up to three quarter of the normal daily diet. For those 
          who lived near the big rivers, fishing developed to become a major 
          pre-occupation and source of protein. Aquatic animals were caught 
          by bone hooks, tidal traps, baskets and nets. 
          A hunting and gathering economy had implications for 
          community size and organisation. The foraging lifestyle of hunters 
          and gatherers meant that they lived in small bands of about thirty 
          to fifty members. Larger groups could not move effectively or find 
          enough food to survive over a long period. Although individual 
          bands had relationships with their neighbours, the immediate 
          community was the focus of social life. Archaeologists have 
          identified several Paleolithic sites in different parts of Africa. 
          These include Sango Bay in Lake Victoria, Still Bay in South-
          Central Africa, Congo South Africa, North Central Africa and East 
          Africa. The Nigerian examples of Paleolithic sites include Mejiro 
          Cave, Near Old Oyo, Rop-Rock Shelter on the Jos Plateau and Iwo 
          Eleru in present day Ondo State. Similarly, a hunting and gathering 
          economy virtually prevented individuals from accumulating 
          private property and basing social distinction on wealth. Given 
          their mobility, the notion of private landed property had no 
          meaning at all. Individuals possessed only a few items like 
          weapons and tools that they can carry easily as they move. Social 
          distinctions nonetheless arose, and some individuals became 
          influential because of their age, strength, courage, intelligence, 
          force of personality or some other traits.`

          invention and adoption of techniques for food production and the 
          domestication of animals. These new techniques altered the natural 
          world and steered early human societies in new direction. Man 
          ceased to be a forager, eternally following his food supply, and 
          became a sedentary being, residing and growing his food in one 
          spot. Instead of just collecting available foods in the wild, 
          Neolithic societies began to nurture plants. Similarly, instead of 
          just stalking game with the intention of killing it for meat, 
          Neolithic men began to capture animals and domesticate them by 
          providing for their needs and supervising their breeding. These

              consequence of this was the development of food producing

              silts. This enriched the soil by making it fertile and suitable for 
              agriculture. The farmers who had moved from the flood plains to 
              the valley were able to produce surplus food and their population 
              grew phenomenally. By 5,000 B.C., the population of Egypt was 
              estimated to be less than 20,000 had by 3,500 B.C., risen to 3 
              million. The growth in population was concomitant with the 
              specialisation and improvement in the culture of the people. 
              Farming communities grew into villages and villages into towns

              Kush, Meroe and Axum however, succeeded Egypt as the centres 
              of civilisations in Africa as we shall see later. It is significant that it 
              was Meroe in Southern Kush that really became the next major 
              centre of civilisation, but had to later give way to Axum. Egypt 
              developed one of the oldest forms of writing, namely, 
              Hieroglyphics, which was a unique combination of pictures and 
              sounds. In the same vein, Egyptians developed the art of irrigation, 
              mathematics and astronomy. They studied the moon and the stars 
              in order to understand the season and calculate the timing of the 
              flood. In the process, they were among those who developed the 
              first twelve months calendar of 365 days as well as the Nilometer 
              for recording the rise and fall of the Nile and water clock for 
              measuring the time of the day.
              In addition, Egyptians believed in many gods. Each god had its 
              shrine and temple. For example, Ra—the sun god, Amun—the god 
              of the wind had separate shrines. Other gods were related to the 
              worship of animals such as the hawk, crocodile, snake, jackal etc. 
              Egyptians also believed in life after death. The bodies of the 
              wealthy were mummified, that is, wrapped in linen cloth and

              Moreover, it is significant that Egyptians high standard of 
              architecture was manifested in the building of pyramids. 
              According to Herodotus, the greatest of these was the pyramid of 
              Gizeh, which was 48ft high and consisted of about two million, 
              three thousand stone blocks of an average weight of 2½ tons that 
              engaged the labour of about 100,000 people for twenty years. The 
              Egyptians were stone builders; they built their temples, statutes and 
              pyramids with stones. Besides, the Pharaohs also employed 
              craftsmen and artists who helped in building their houses with mud 
              walls, strong wooden doors and windows.
              In the early dynastic period, Egypt established extensive trade 
              links with the outside world. It imported silver from the Aegen 
              Islands, Obsidian from Ethiopia, gold and copper from the Red Sea 
              hills. Hence, while-it could be said that agriculture was the pillar of 
              the Egyptian economy; trade was hence merely one of the 
              superstructures. Egyptian influence spread through the Nile Valley 
              region. As they found their expansion towards Asia threatened by 
              the Hittites, the Egyptians turned attention southwards. Their 
              colonies grew along the Nile Valley. Their motives were the search 
              for security and gold. Hence, by 1500 B.C., they had conquered 
              and annexed all the territories along the Nile Valley as far as the 4th
              cataract and made themselves master of Kush (present day Sudan).
              Majority of the Egyptians were farmers who produced 
              agricultural surplus on which the wealth, power and fame of 
              Egyptian civilisation was built. The peasants lived in small mud 
              houses, ate bread, onions and fish. Their main crops were wheat, 
              barley and flax. They also grew figs and grapes. They kept cattle, 
              goats, geese and hunted wild birds. They harvested large surplus 
              from their crops, but these were taken by Pharaohs’ tax masters 
              leaving them with just enough to feed themselves. Peasant farmers 
              were heavily taxed. Taxes were assessed according to the level of 
              the Nile. Peasant labours were used for large irrigation works, 
              digging of canals and building large stone palaces.`

              Egypt becoming greatly cosmopolitan, and some of the foreign 
              influences that entered the culture eventually began to work 
              negatively on the state. In 1670 B.C., the first foreign invasion of 
              Egypt occurred, when the Hyksos invaded the Delta from Western 
              Asia using bronze weapons superior to the copper types used by 
              the Egyptians. They rode horse - drawn chariots, but were later 
              driven out by the Thebean kings (1570 - 1085 B.C.). However, 
              after 1100 B.C., the empire was attacked from across the desert in 
              the west and in the Mediterranean in the north. By 1050 B.C., 
              Persia and Nubia had broken free. There followed invasions from 
              Nubia, Assyria and Persia.
              By 666 B.C., Egyptian land was invaded and its capital sacked. 
              Egypt was despoiled of its wealth and magnificence by the 
              Assyrians, whose culture included iron metallurgy. After this 
              invasion from a power from across the Mediterranean Sea, 
              Pharaonic Egypt was never to recover its earlier grandeur. Today, 
              what remains of that great African culture or civilisation are the

              the Nile Valley and around the Horn of Africa. With the decline of 
              Egypt emerged the kingdom of Kush that spread over the present 
              day Republic of Sudan and lay to the south of Egypt as the next 
              centre of African civilisation. Like Egypt, Kush depended on the 
              river Nile for its life.`

              was under Egyptian influence. However, with the decline of Egypt 
              as from about 1100 B.C., its political control of Nubia (Northern 
              Sudan) became tenuous. Thereafter, the local rulers of Nubia built 
              a kingdom known as Kush. Kush seized the opportunity of the 
              decline to assert its independence. In 700 B.C., the Kushite King, 
              Kashta, rebelled against the Egyptian authority and declared Kush 
              an independent kingdom. He also invaded and conquered Egypt 
              and ruled over her as far as Thebes, capital of Upper Egypt. 
              Kashta’s son, Piankhy, completed the conquest of Egypt. It is 
              significant to note that, the Kushite kings established the 25th 
              dynasty in Egypt. Taharqa, Piankhy’s son and successor, ruled at a 
              time when Egypt was threatened by the Assyrians. Consequently, 
              he moved his capital to the Egyptian Delta so as to keep watch 
              over external aggression from Asia Minor. However, in 671 B.C., 
              Egypt was attacked by Assyria and Taharqa was driven to 
              Memphis. In 669 B.C., he drove out the Assyrians, but did not 
              succeed in eliminating their threat. They eventually drove him out 
              of Egypt in 666 B.C., and he died in 663 B.C.
              The Kushites were finally outsted from Egypt in the reign of 
              his successor Tanwetamani. Having been finally flushed out of 
              Egypt, the Kushite kings returned to Napata, their ancient capital, 
              as kings of Upper and Lower Egypt. Their kingdom extended as 
              far south as Sennar and as far north as Kalabsha in Egyptian 
              Nubia. The kingdom of Kush was ruled from Napata until the 6th

              Potasimto captured Napata. Consequently, the capital of Kush was 
              transferred to Meroe. Meroe lay at the northern end of the tropical 
              rainfall belt. It had great expanse of land under cultivation during 
              the rainy season. Put differently, Meroe stands within the region of 
              annual rainfall – the broad valleys of the Butana, the Wadi 
              Awateib and the Wadi Hawad – which produced an abundance of 
              crops and pasture for animals (advantages lacking in the Napata 
              region) to support an urban civilisation.
              Meroe, therefore, benefited from the annual floods of the River 
              Nile and River Atbara, its tributary. As a result of all these 
              ecological advantages, crops could be grown in the plains and in 
              the river valley. Cattle rearing were also done.
              In addition, Meroe lay on a trade route along the River Atbara 
              into the Abyssinian hills and hence to India. The city was, 
              therefore, well placed for trade as it is being located on a navigable 
              stretch of river at the end of easy caravan routes from the Red Sea.
              Furthermore, Meroe was a centre of iron mining. There was an 
              abundance of iron ore as well as timber for iron-smelting and it is 
              very significant that iron-technology in Kush (as in Egypt) dates 
              from after this time. The production of iron weapons in Meroe
              greatly contributed to the military superiority of Kush over its 
              neighbours and enabled it to control the trade routes leading to 
              16 V.O. Edo
              Egypt and the Red Sea Coast. All these economic advantages made 
              Meroe more attractive as a capital than Napata. From their capital 
              at Meroe, the Kushites traded with the people of the Sudanic Belt 
              of Africa, Egypt, Saudi-Arabia and Abysinia (Ethiopian 
              Highlands). Its export included ivory, slaves, animal skins, ostrich 
              feather, ebony, gold etc.`

              continent, and it caused a dramatic change in the ways of life as 
              well as the social and political organisation of the African peoples. 
              Most of Africa went directly from a predominantly stone-using

              tools and weapons. But the introduction of this technology must 
              have been gradual. Stone tools and weapons continued long in use

              How the technology of iron-smelting emerged in Africa is still 
              a much debated question. Also, decisive evidence as to the source

              dates of its arrival in various parts of the continent, south of the 
              Sahara would be of extremely great value for our understanding of 
              a critical period in the history of the continent. It is, however, very 
              probable that East and Central Africa acquired this knowledge 
              through diffusion from Meroe. In West Africa, the proof is more 
              difficult to ascertain. Some scholars suggest diffusion from North 
              Africa, with Carthage as the probable origin from where it came to 
              West Africa. There is, however, need for further research to

              A number of statues were taken away, including the Bronze Head

              Axum, therefore, became the third ancient African centre of 
              civilisation. In its hey days, it was known as the Axumite kingdom 
              in the land now called Ethiopia. Axum was for a long time a rival 
              of the Meroitic kingdom. Iron-smelting technology reached Axum 
              from Southwest Asia at about the same time as it came to Kush 
              and Egypt, that is, about the 6th century B.C. However, the 
              immense expansion of Axumite power was contemporaneous with 
              the decline of Meroe.
              The kingdom of Axum covered an area, which was about 
              300km by 160km. Axum was a rich agricultural kingdom. The 
              crops planted include wheat and other cereals. The Axumite people 
              used ploughs drawn by oxen to till their soil. They raised 
              livestock’s which included sheep, cattle, goat etc. They were also 
              able to domesticate elephants. Like the Kushites, the Axumites 
              were artisans and craftsmen—blacksmiths, metal workers, potters, 
              builders and carvers. The kingdom was also noted for commerce. 
              Axum has been described as the main commercial centre between 
              the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean during this period. Its 
              hinterland provided ivory, shells, gold etc. Axum’s major port was 
              Adulis and this attracted traders from Greece, Persia and India. 
              Apart from the items mentioned above, others include olive oil 
              from Italy, slaves, wine, cereals and grape juice from Egypt.`

              But Axum maintained immense commercial transactions with 
              many other nations from the first century onwards. Axumite 
              commercial relations were obviously aided by the kingdom's 
              employment of three languages for communication. These were 
              Ge’ez (Ethiopic), Greek (also used occasionally in public 
              documents), and Sabaean, the language of the Yemen.
              The kingdom of Axum was perhaps the first state in Africa to 
              introduce its own coin. It minted its own gold, silver and copper 
              coins. The names of its kings as well as motto were inscribed on 
              their coins. The first king of Axum to put coin into circulation was 
              called Edybis and this took place in the 2nd half of the 3rd century 
              A.D. Moreover, Axum had a great army with which it embarked 
              on impressive military campaigns. For example, the king of Axum 
              campaigned northwards as far as the River Nile and it captured 
              Meroe in 350 A.D. Towards the south, it went as far as the

              Yemen. Under king Ezana in early 4th century A.D., the Axumites

              to collapse from the 6th century A.D., due to a number of factors, 
              having reached the height of its power in this period. The decline 
              of Axum was brought about by the Persian conquest of Yemen and 
              the Arab conquest of Egypt, which disrupted commerce in the Red 
              Sea. By 700 A.D., its trade links with India and the Eastern 
              Mediterranean had been disconnected. At this period, groups of 
              Axumites began to migrate into the interior of Ethiopia mixing 
              with the indigenous people. The products of this admixture were 
              the people of Amhara, Tigre and Gojam who are the nucleus of the 
              present day Ethiopia. Hence, it could be argued that the rise of 
              Islam and its spread across northern Africa in the 6th and 7th 
              centuries A.D. caused much of the trade of Axum to be diverted 
              away from the Red Sea from where came the bulk of Axumite 
              commerce. The trade between the Indian Ocean and the 
              Mediterranean now passed through the Persian Gulf. Besides, 
              environmental deterioration just as it hit Meroe also affected the 
              fortunes of Axum. The felling of trees and the exploitation of soil 
              led to soil infertility and erosion as was the kingdom of Meroe, 
              when it collapsed. By 800 A.D., Axum had become depleted and 
              the capital had been moved to the interior central Island of 
              Ethiopia where there could be found a more distinctive African 
              Christian culture.`

      title: "Introduction",
      content: `Indigenous political organisations discuss political organisations or 
        institutions which had been established by the African indigenous 
        people before the advent of Western system. African societies have 
        often linked their institutional power with supernatural elements 
        which can be located in various myths of origin. African political 
        systems and institutions were traditionally mostly based on kinship 
        and on lineage sanctioned by a founding myth. Thus, there exists a 
        lot of historical propaganda to conceptualise political institutions in 
        Africa. Examples are widespread in Africa. Among the Yoruba of 
        south-western Nigeria, Oduduwa, who was an eponymous 
        ancestor, became the first king of Ife which is the cradle of the 
        Yoruba society. The Bayajidda legend in Hausaland—the 
        Bayajidda legend is probably regarded as the most important single 
        source for Hausa history. The Zulu (of South Africa) believe that 
        Unkulunku (the High God) created chiefs in the last order of 
        creation to maintain social stability. Among the Nyoro of the 
        Bunyoro – Kitara Kingdom located in western Uganda-Ruhanga 
        (God) created the earth and the first family, serving as the locus of 
        Pedigree of the Nyoro. This suggests that in many African 
        societies, the family is the unit of political culture. Indeed, the 
        family system in African forms the bedrock of political 
        organisation and the wherewithal of comprehending social 
        relations, leadership trust and the basis of experimenting and 
        implementing the rule of law which contextualises locus of power, 
        legitimacy and conflict resolution as will be discussed in the course 
        of this chapter. According to Fortes, the Tallensi of Northern 
        Ghana located their origin in the ancestors referred to as “tendana”. 
        Similarly, the Nupe anchored their origin on the super-power of 
        Tsoede. All over Africa, there are myths to explain and justify the 
        origin of political culture. The myths, often pre-suppose the fact 
        24 A.A. Adedire and S.A. Okunade
        that society or state is an offshoot of the supernatural (who controls 
        events) in the social engineering. 
        For example, African may describe their gods or heroes in as 
        many ways as the myriads of languages which abound in the 
        continent but behind this multiplicity of language and concepts 
        lurks a uniformity of metaphysics and, even, of epistemology. 
        Such uniformity is to be found in the critical areas of the political 
        thought system. These include beliefs about the origins and nature 
        of the state, the authority of the ruler, the rights of citizens and 
        social structure, and so on.`

        political organisations. The parameter for measuring the social 
        relevance of whatever political organisations in vogue is the 
        application of the rule of law in African societies, it does not entail 
        the existence of written statutes for regulating behaviour. The rule 
        of law, on the other hand, may be constructed to mean respect for 
        and adherence to the machinery of justice geared towards conflict 
        resolution in African societies. Significantly, every society, at one 
        time or the other has evolved its own peculiar political system 
        whose structure and functions are germane to the 
        institutionalisation of social order and harmony eked out of a web

        The legendary African, Nelson Mandela, described former 
        indigenous political institutions thus: “Then our people lived 
        peacefully, under the democratic rule of their kings.... Then the 
        country was ours, in our name and right.... All men were free and 
        equal and this was the foundation of government. The council of 
        elders was so completely democratic that all members of the tribe 
        could participate in its deliberation. Chief and subject, warrior and 
        medicine man, all took part and endeavoured to influence its 
        decision” (Ayittey, G.B.N. 1992). Africa betrayed. New York:

        There have always existed different forms of governance 
        within African societies, even before the advent of the colonial 
        Indigenous African Political System 25
        powers. These were African based, and built around the values, 
        traditions and norms of Africans. These forms of governance did 
        not conform to the western notions of written constitutionalism, 
        which entailed a unilateral form of governance where the need for 
        a controlled, formal, governmental authority, as seen in western 
        societies, is expressed. Pre-colonial African societies had laws, 
        which while not manifesting as codified or formal laws, were of 
        the nature that they might be heard rather than seen. In pre-colonial 
        African societies, governance was usually determined by existing 
        systems of succession to power. Societal norms regulated these 
        systems of succession to office and legitimacy was conferred 
        through the respect accorded to these lines of authority. Inherent 
        values did exist in the different political systems practiced in those 
        societies. Also within the pre-colonial African societies, there were 
        checks and balances on the powers of the rulers. These were
        evidenced in some of the practices, traditions and beliefs of the 
        different societies. The allegiance of the subjects could, for 
        example, easily be transferred from one ruler to another, if the 
        ruler turned out to be despotic, cruel or a tyrant. The ruler is also 
        expected to earn the respect of his people, and this was not based 
        on force or intimidation.

        The powers and privileges of African kings were, no doubt, 
        exceedingly great but in practice they were circumscribed. All 
        kings were limited by the customs and usages of their kingdoms as 
        well as by the structure of governments within which they had to 
        operate. Thus, the absolutism of African ruler was more apparent 
        than real. The king was expected to work, in almost all cases, 
        within a structure characterised by several layers of chieftaincy 
        groups, secret religious cults, which exercised great powers of 
        control and age-grade associations. All these groups were sources 
        of pressure and checks on the rulers’ use of the powers allowed by 
        his society. The African political model did not provide for 
        absolutism or tyranny. All societies provide elaborate and explicit 
        rules of behaviour for their rulers. They expect their rulers to 
        uphold their traditions, defend their territory from aggressors, 
        expand, if possible, their wealth through wars but they also expect 
        them to be just, considerate and conscious of the conventions and 
        interests of the people at all times. In short, kings are looked upon 
        as the symbols of the authority and legitimacy of their kingdoms. 
        Their rights and privileges are expected to be coterminous, and no 
        more, with those which the society would ordinarily confer on the 
        people. Thus, when a king is eulogised as the owner of all the 
        territories in his kingdom, it is not intended to mean anything more 
        than that he is the symbol of the people’s ancestry and legitimacy 
        of their claim to the lands they occupy.
        Just as the ruler’s right to issue commands and be obeyed was 
        validated by custom and the common good of the society, the 
        obligation of the people to obey derived from the acceptance of a 
        common descent, custom and a common perception of the good of 
        the society. All African societies operated within the context of 
        myths which provided the ideological framework for the 
        relationship between the ruler and the ruled. Acceptance of the 
        myth of descent and the superintending role of the supernatural 
        world involves a disposition to obey. So also is the general belief 
        in the organic nature of the society. The society is a system of 
        interlocking familial relationships and destinies. There is, 
        therefore, a common good which is in the interest of all to protect 
        and enhance. To do otherwise is to invoke the wrath of the god(s) 
        or ancestors whose existence provides an essential ingredient of 
        social order.`

      title : "African Family System in the Context of Political Culture",
      content : `J.F. Ade Ajayi (1985:11-12) posits that the family is the unit of 
        political system in Africa. It is the bedrock of understanding the 
        dynamics of power relations and devolution of power as well as 
        issuance of wielding of authority germane to social engineering. 
        The art of living together (in lineage and compounds) suggests a 
        great deal of communalism and collective ethos.
        Sociologists and cultural anthropologists identified various 
        types of family system. There are basically nuclear and extended 
        family systems (which are popular reference points in a discussion 
        about the family). In a nuclear family system, the father, the 
        mother and their children form the nucleus of relationship. This is 
        the foundation of a much larger family in Africa. Thus, the nuclear 
        Indigenous African Political System 27
        family is a means to an end of power relations and political culture. 
        It is significant, therefore, to observe that the nuclear family is the 
        foundation of a political system exhibitable in the power holdings 
        and authority wielding within the family set-up. Obviously, there is 
        hierarchy of power in the family system in Africa. 
        The head of the family (the father) often issues forth power 
        being the oldest and experienced member of the family web. The 
        father often exhibits executive position, and power and authority 
        flow from him. He is the food provider (bread winner), protector 
        (securing the future livelihood) of other members of the family, 
        executor of plans and projects, and facilitator of peace and 
        harmony of the family. His personality towers, far and above other 
        members of the family but he does not arrogate autocratic power to 
        himself because he has confidence in his wife and mother of his 
        children.`

        usually acts as a safety valve, controller of achievable goals for the 
        family, and a pursuer of justice, and has advisory roles to play in 
        the scheme of developments. The development of the family and 
        protection over health, nutrition, aspiration and projection are 
        evidences of her capacity to maintain balance of power within the 
        family. In a nutshell, the political rights and roles of an African 
        mother (within the family system) are complementary to those of 
        the father. Thus, consultation and consolidation on agenda of 
        development resonated in the display and control of power by both 
        father (executive power holder) and the African mother 
        (checkmate of power).
        Fundamentally, there are checks and balances of power and 
        authority in African family organisation. In patrilineal society 
        (such as in Nigeria), the executive power of the father looms large 
        while in matrilineal society (such as in Ghana) the political power 
        of the mother supersedes that of the father. As there are Queen 
        mothers in Ghana, there are female kings in Nigeria (Ondo and Ile￾Oluji). Therefore, political rights and roles are not stereotypically

        shared obligations and common interests. The second type is the 
        polygamous extended family which consists of an adult male, his 
        two or many wives and children. The paralegal polygamous 
        extended family is peculiar to West African societies. Family is 
        very important throughout Africa. Families, not individuals, are the 
        building blocks of African society. Most people live in households 
        that include not only the nuclear family (mother, father and 
        children) but also members of their extended family (grandparents, 
        aunts, uncles, cousins, and others). Family members act as both an 
        economic and emotional network and provide individuals with a 
        sense of who they are and where they belong.
        From the trend of discussion in this section, African family 
        system symbolises power relations and legitimacy of authority. It 
        is in the family system (by tradition that power thereto evolved). 
        The evolution of political power, therefore, suggests the basis of 
        understanding the foundation of political culture in African 
        societies. The failure of the family system in modern African 
        obviously translates to the collapse of good governance as 
        presently witnessed in contemporary African society. Emphasis is 
        here placed on the fact that the indigenous family in Africa had a 
        lot that it offered within the context of traditionalism. These

        title : "Type of African Political Systems ",
        content : `There are basically four types of political systems that exist in 
        traditional African societies. The first type is known as centralised 
        political organisation, second involved rulers with centralised 
        authority. The third category of society however showcased the 
        characteristics of both centralised and non-centralised political 
        organisation and the fourth had to do with small band societies 
        which had their political organisation synonymous with kinship 
        organisation. Ajayi 2005:81-82, posits that about four types of 
        political systems can be identified among traditional African 
        Societies, these include those who operated the centralised political 
        organisation model. In this group, the societies existed as separate, 
        distinct and independent political entities. Such ethnic groups that 
        fall under this category include the Yoruba and Hausa of Nigeria, 
        the Fanti and Ashanti of Ghana, as well as the Mossi of Burkina￾Faso. Others were the Swazi and Zulu of South Africa as well as 
        the Buganda. Besides, there were African societies that dispensed 
        with monocratic rulers and preferred to govern themselves. These 
        societies can be referred to as non-centralised societies. Examples, 
        of these were the Igbo of Nigeria, the Kru of Liberia, and the 
        Tallensi of Ghana. They also included the Konkomba of Togoland, 
        the Somali, the Jie of Uganda, and the Mbeere of Kenya. Yet 
        others included the Massai and the Nyjakusa of Tanzania. 
        In addition, there were those societies that exhibited the 
        characteristics of the above two categories, that is, characteristics 
        of centralised political organisation and non-centralised societies. 
        Such societies are referred to as poly cephalous. It is significant 
        that the Kpelle of Liberia practised this type of political system. 
        They had no king or chief; rather, there were paramount chiefs 
        with equal authority.
        Finally, there were the small band societies that had their 
        political organisation synonymous with kinship organisation. 
        Examples could be found among the pygmies living in the forests 
        between Zaire and Angola and the Khoisan of the Kahalari Desert 
        in Southern Africa. The band societies had diffused political 
        leadership. They were preoccupied with hunting, food gathering or 
        animal husbandry.

        All said, whatever be the nature of the political system in any 
        African society, the king by whatever name he was called, was 
        regarded as paramount and ruled with the support of a group of 
        chiefs also called by different names among the different ethnic 
        groups. Among the Yoruba, it was and is still called the Igbimo
        (Council of Chiefs). It would also appear that the king, even 
        though paramount, was not autocratic. Even if he was autocratic in 
        theory, he was not so in practice. This was the trend virtually 
        throughout the continent of Africa. The king was absolute only in 
        name. To this extent, the king was at the head of the political 
        hierarchy in any African kingdom. He was assisted by a group of 
        chiefs of varying and different ranks. However, at the village level, 
        there was also a leader known as the village head or headman. Like 
        the king, he presided over the affairs of the village. Among the 
        Yoruba, he was and is still called the Baálѐ. In the Benin kingdom, 
        the Enogie presided over the villages. The king in the traditional 
        African societies performed numerous political functions. He was 
        the overseer of public affairs. He presided over the court for the 
        administration of justice. This was the most significant task of a 
        Shona Chief. Among the Shona, he was the guardian of social 
        morality called Rupenya (life) and Simba (strength, vitality, and 
        well-being). The African king was the religious or spiritual head of 
        the society. Indeed, he represented the ancestral spirits of land and 
        engaged in ritual sacrifice and offerings to curry their favour for 
        the development of the society. Thus, it can be summarised that the 
        traditional African king performed executive, legislative and 
        judicial functions.`

        content : `In the centralised traditional political systems in Africa, authority 
        was centralised in a hierarchical order. The king was at the apex of 
        the political organisation and highly revered by his subjects. At the 
        lower echelon of administration were the village heads. However, 
        the enormity of centralisation was different from one African 
        society to the other. It is significant that subsumed in the 
        centralised structures of political organisation was the 
        Indigenous African Political System 31
        concentration of power in the hands of few political rulers, which 
        facilitated abuse of power. Indeed, the abuse of power was a 
        flagrant disregard for the rule of law, which often called to 
        question the manipulation of state apparatus for governance, and 
        gave vent to reactions and counter-reactions in African 
        communities.

        However, the occurrence of the abuse of power was checked 
        and controlled through institutionalised machineries. In fact, 
        institutional checks and balances came through constitutional 
        prerequisites of empowerment. For instance, after the installation 
        of a king in Benin and Oyo, they usually had consultation with the 
        council of Chiefs known as the Uzama and Oyomesi respectively. 
        The consultation was based on the recognition of the advisory 
        roles of the councils. Without doubt, the chiefs had played very 
        prominent roles in the king’s installation as the overall head of the 
        community. Also, the age-grades and members of the secret cults 
        were formidable apparatus for enforcing social ethnics, especially 
        among the Igbo and peoples of the Niger Delta in Nigeria. With 
        these institutions on ground, it would be foolhardy for the king not 
        to carry them along. From the afore-stated, it is important that the 
        king must respect tradition; failure to do this was greeted with 
        massive protests and dethronement, which differed from one 
        African society to the other. In the old Oyo Empire, the king might 
        be made by the Oyomesi to “open the calabash”, that is, commit 
        suicide. Very few African communities did not have 
        institutionalised methods of removing their kings from office. The 
        emirate system, for example, had no formal method of destooling 
        the Sultan of Sokoto, even though he could be devolved. The 
        implication of this is that the king cannot rule arbitrarily, knowing 
        fully well that if he did, the people could rise against him and 
        remove him from office.`

          title : "Characteristics of Non-Monocratic Societies",
          content : `The bedrock of the maintenance of law and order in non￾monocratic societies in Africa was the diffusion of political power. 
        At this point, authority was endowed in people of virtuous and 
        proven integrity as well as titled men. For instance, in Igbo 
        32 A.A. Adedire and S.A. Okunade
        traditional political organisation titled societies played a crucial 
        role. The most common of them was the Ozo and Nze which was 
        conferred on men of honour and virtue. Holders of the title could, 
        among other things, intervene in disputes and bring peace in their 
        communities. This representative model made popular participa￾tion in governance possible. Indeed, governance was by consensus. 
        There was no imposition or reinforcement of ideas by the 
        individual. Decision-making was based on ideals that were popular 
        and acceptable to the community. However, even in current 
        debates in Nigeria, most people continue to view Igbo society as 
        being traditionally based on ‘democratic principles’ as expressed in 
        the common proverb Igbo enwe(ghi) eze, ‘the Igbo have no king’ 
        but this does not mean that they had no state, just as with ancient 
        Egbas.

        Contrasting the centralised political system, misuses of 
        traditional political power in non-centralised societies were very 
        limited and wherever discovered there were many institutional and 
        constitutional checks against them. Clearly, the councils, the elders 
        and the titled men could derail in their constitutional 
        responsibilities towards the people for reasons best known to them. 
        The existence of a general assembly, where meetings were held 
        and important issues were raised and discussed was one of the 
        constitutional checks against abuse of power and shirking of 
        responsibilities. In such general meetings, actions of leaders could 
        be reproved. It would be appropriate for them to sue for peace.
        Closely related to the first point above were the age-grades. 
        This was also another formidable institutional control against 
        autocracy. The age grades were empowered by the community to 
        carry out seemingly difficult task in public works, warfare and 
        other social callings. They serve as enforcers and facilitators of 
        public or community will. Among the segmented societies of the 
        western Delta area of Nigeria, there were diverse categories of the 
        age-grades performing different roles in the society. The most 
        junior set was made up of boys less than fifteen years, who 
        executed commercial duties like sweeping and clearing village 
        paths. The next groups were men of about forty years old who 
        functioned basically as the labour force. They constructed public 
        Indigenous African Political System 33
        buildings and major projects within the society. They were also the 
        men used in defence of the society. The last age-grade comprised 
        men of about fifty years old and above. These men constituted the 
        council of elders in the society. Also, the Tiv, for example, 
        diligently use age-grades as powerful forces to reckon with. As a 
        matter of fact, the Tiv of Nigeria lived in constant fear of powerful 
        domination by power possessors. They often resisted it. Thus the 
        Igbo, Tiv and Dagaaba were always aware of political structure of 
        the type peculiar to the centralised societies but merely used 
        centralised power of a limited form during warfare. Such a power 
        was discarded at the time of peace.

        Recognition of achievements, virtues and valour was pertinent 
        to non-centralised societies. Titles were a metaphor for wealth, 
        influence and prestige, which invested on holder advantages of 
        having a voice in the development of their communities. Thus title 
        holders, as role-models in the public eyes were heard and listened 
        to from time to time. They could, therefore, moderate disputes and 
        check excessive manipulations of political authority. Association 
        of craftsmen and warriors usually played monitoring roles to 
        checkmate abuses of political authority. These are widespread in 
        Igbo communities and Somali societies respectively.
        Kinship ties were very strong in segmented societies and they 
        constituted formidable forces against abuse of power. The kingship 
        groups provided the basis for moderating the power of the 
        councils, elders and leaders of segmented societies. This mode of 
        moderation ensured the limitation of the exercise of political 
        authority. Moreover, communal customs, rituals, values and 
        sanctions have been considered by Ikelegbe to have “guided and 
        moderated leadership”. He also adjudges “mode of succession” in 
        segmented societies, as militating against undue exercise of power. 
        Indeed political offices were hardly hereditary and this suggests 
        that political authority would have meant greater opportunities for 
        public service and each holder upholds a strong point of 
        expectation towards contributing to the community through 
        performance. In this way, title holders hardly thought of engaging 
        in reckless leadership or total neglect of responsibilities. From the 
        above-mentioned, thus, it could be said that unlike the centralised 
        34 A.A. Adedire and S.A. Okunade
        political system, abuse of traditional political power in segmented 
        societies was restricted in view of the various measures through 
        which they could be checked. `

          title : "Conflicts and Conflict Resolution in African Society",
          content : `Part of the agenda of political culture in African society was the 
        phenomenon of conflicts and conflicts resolution which quite often 
        set the pace of development in the scheme of things. To understand 
        the concept of conflicts is akin to situating it within the context of
        political culture. Conflicts occur naturally in the society. It is part 
        of life with lots of challenges. Simply defined, conflict is a clash of 
        interest among two or more parties to it. Conflict permeates every 
        human society. It cannot be avoided but can be prevented, 
        managed and resolved. Conflict, therefore, is very necessary and 
        can set the pace for development in a society when properly 
        handled. In other words, conflicts have its handling style.
        In pre-colonial African society, conflict was the order of the 
        day. It happened so frequently and for a desired purpose. Conflict 
        can occur, in that context, with a view to determining the personal 
        temperament of people, test the character traits, weigh the interest 
        of the people in other neighbouring kingdoms, test the level of 
        neighbourhood hospitality and showcase the ammunitions 
        manufactured by one kingdom or the other. In all the above 
        conflict generating situations, there was always a signal to peaceful 
        atmosphere and strength of neighbours and kingdoms. Indeed, it is 
        within the atmosphere of peace that development can take place. 
        Thus conflicting parties, neighbours and communities in the pre￾colonial African societies often had a sense of conflict 
        management and resolution. 
        The handling style of conflict in pre-colonial African society 
        was focused on conflict management and resolution. Some 
        methods were also in place to make the handling style of conflict 
        effective and workable. These included adjudication, negotiation, 
        reconciliation, meditation and arbitration. The wedlock of both 
        handling styles and the anchorable mechanism stood out, African 
        society in the context of conflict de-escalation. Conflict 
        management involves the level of control attendant on the stages of 
        Indigenous African Political System 35
        the conflict. Thus level of conflict management was determined by 
        the severity of the issues. Although conflict management does not 
        write off all the issues of conflict, greater percentage of them 
        would have been controlled.

        Conflict resolution is more concrete evidence of checking off 
        the root of conflicts. In pre-colonial Africa, conflict resolution 
        wrote off issues of conflict. It was more effective than conflict 
        management because of the mechanism of rating and the 
        mechanism of the engaging techniques. Thus in African society, 
        there were institutions of conflict resolutions. These included 
        palace/political institution (Kings and chiefs), family institution 
        (head of the family), age-grade associations (the head), market 
        institution (market leaders, commodity association (executive 
        leaders), professional guilds (the leaders) and secret societies (their 
        leaders). In order to ensure proper peace making and conflict 
        resolutions, leaders of the various institutions were always at their 
        best to facilitate peace and enhance harmony in Africa.
        In traditional Africa, there was a way of ensuring the 
        effectiveness of modes of conflicts resolutions. Apart from the fact 
        that the deities and the ancestors watch over the scene, the rules of 
        conflict resolutions were also followed to the letter. Again, the rule 
        of the law which was earlier mentioned in this chapter was 
        favourably applied. Furthermore, the wisdoms of elders along the 
        line of the norms and customs, was practically displayed. Elders 
        are respected as trustworthy mediators all over Africa, because of 
        their accumulated experiences and wisdom. The concept of agba
        (elders) in Yoruba conflict management system, for example, is a 
        Yoruba socio-political model for conflict resolution, and it is the 
        third-party that is responsible for effective conflict resolution in 
        indigenous Yoruba societies. Agba (elders) were usually relied 
        upon as arbitrators and agents of conflict resolution in view of 
        certain qualities possessed by this category of human beings.
        Agba (elders) are respected individuals identified by 
        age and other qualities, which mark them out in their 
        families, communities, nations, regions and the world. 
        To be identified as an agba (elder), s/he must be 
        fearless person (alakikanju); s/he must be 
        knowledgeable and wise but must be someone who 
        gives room for criticisms (ologbon, oloye, afimo ti 
        elomiran se); s/he must be tolerant (alamumora); s/he 
        must be upright in all ways (olotito, olododo); s/he 
        must not be selfish (anikanjopon).
        As a matter of fact, a ceremony usually concluded the conflict 
        resolution scene. This involved the parties to the conflict to exhibit 
        willingness to give peace a chance by eating some lobe of broken 
        kolanut as in the Igbo society, eating pieces of bean cake (akara)
        as among the Yoruba or even drinking milk from the same 
        calabash as among the Fulani of Northern Nigeria and the Masai of 
        East Africa, to name a few. Thus the ceremony concluding the 
        scene of conflict resolution was an attestation to the fact that the 
        parties to the conflict have vowed never to allow such a conflict to 
        erupt again. It also shows the approval of the seal of the 
        supernatural on the peace move or initiative.
        In the process of restoring conflict, oath taking and 
        administration of ordeal were resorted to. This was to ascertain the 
        truth and validity, innocence and honesty of purpose. The oath￾taking include touching war or farm implements and the like. On 
        the other hand, the ordeal was by drinking concocted water from 
        smithery or sass wood. Certain pronouncement was made to the 
        objects in questions and few curses could also follow the 
        pronouncements.

        Marriage is one of the means to the prevention, management

        religion changed the societal life of indigenous Africans. 
        Marriages reduced inter-group wars as children who possessed 
        mixed blood were used to prevent, manage and resolve conflict. 
        Most of those marriages were inter-cultural and most times involve 
        the royalty such as the one between Adaeze, the daughter of Obi 
        Ossa; of Aboh and Amain, the king boy of Brass and that between 
        King Jaja’s daughter and Alafin of Oyo and Alafin of Oyo’s 
        daughter and King Jaja in 1730.
        The colonial administration introduced colonial statutes, 
        ordinances and law which were used to transform African society, 
        thereby jettisoning the hitherto existing conflict resolution model 
        in traditional African society. The pre-colonial African institution 
        of conflict resolution was overturned with the colonial legal courts. 
        Thus, litigation was the method used by the colonial administrators 
        to institutionalise peace and order. Many African kings fell prey of 
        the litigation process and were severely punished.
        It is significant to note that litigations led the African society to 
        “troubled waters”. Not only were there inadequacies of the 
        existence of legal personnel to administer justice, the nature of the 
        administered justice was corrosive. Thus in post-independence era, 
        new ideas emerged towards decongesting the colonial law courts. 
        This brought about the idea of introducing Alternative Dispute 
        Resolution (ADR), which has since been re-christened—
        Appropriate Dispute Resolution (ADR) which largely borrowed 
        from hitherto existed conflict resolution model of African style. 
        Consequently, conflict resolutions are, indeed a focal point in the 
        administration of justice, development initiative, organising 
        programming and promotion of cultural heritage within the realm 
        of political culture.

        viewed from the microscopic lens of political culture. The family 
        has been conceptualised as the unit of political culture in Africa. 
        Until the breakdown of this family system, unity of purpose and 
        social harmony were instutionalised. African kings and chiefs as 
        well as other socio-political organisations (such as the age-grade 
        association) played tremendous role in fostering peace and 
        harmony among Africans. As natural as conflict was, conflict 
        management and conflict resolution were mechanisms of conflicts 
        handling style in pre-colonial Africa. Such conflict handling styles 
        were adjudged to be fundamental to the instutionalisation of peace 
        which was the prerequisite for development agenda in African 
        political culture. Thus conflict resolution was the hallmark of 
        political institution in traditional Africa. The modern day political 
        development in Africa, however, jettisoned the hitherto existed 
        conflict resolutions model that was later reshaped and re-christened 
        as Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) that has overwhelmed 
        the colonial structure of the maintenance of law and order.

        African leaders who inherited the political culture of the 
        colonial administrators were torn between two gruesome worlds of 
        governance, viz-a-viz traditionalism and modern democracy. The 
        problems facing African leaders today include unceremonious 
        dismissal from political office by military coup d’état kleptocracy 
        which is borne out of official greed; electoral malpractices and 
        euphoria for foreign standards. 
        A critical review of the problems will suggest that African 
        political leaders find it difficult to apply foreign rule to traditional 
        governance. The crucial point to note is that traditional African 
        government lacked the components of elective government. 
        Traditional African states were sometimes ethnic-based as opposed 
        to present-day multi-ethnic states. Furthermore, Ekong E. Ekong 
        reasoned that public accountability of funds was absent in 
        traditional African government, adaptation of modern political 
        systems of the west has been on trial and error basis. However, not 
        all nations’ states were mono-national entities. There were 
        conquests and assimilations sometimes by Oyo, Benin, Ghana and 
        Mali empires which grew beyond mono-national boundaries and 
        impacted on other people/nations within their legal boundaries. 
        Most African countries now practise presidential system of 
        government. There are, however, three categories of presidential 
        regimes in Africa namely: rationalised, parliamentary and partisan 
        regimes. The rationalised category is characterised by military 
        regimes bereft of political party system as experienced in Uganda, 
        Nigeria, Mauritania Central African Republic and Chad.
        Indigenous African Political System 39
        The parliamentary system of governance networks with the 
        presidential system of government and it is peculiar to both the 
        Francophone and Anglophone countries in Africa. Presidentialism 
        under one-party state structure is operational in Ivory Coast, 
        Gabon, Cameroun, Togo, Zaire, Tanzania and Kenya. The partisan 
        regime has the characteristics of multi-party system and can be 
        identified in Senegal, Nigeria’s Second Republic and Ghana’s 
        Third Republic.

        As earlier stated, African leaders are currently in a dilemma to 
        apply new political orientation to the old dispensation. The 
        emergent situation is that African leaders (as presidents) often 
        formulated several theories to explain their ideological leanings. 
        Some of the theories have been found to be contradictory to the 
        principles governing their administration. As a matter of fact, most 
        African leaders have used monarchical paradox to establish their 
        claims for adapting presidential rule. Similarly, legitimating 
        paradigms have been cited here namely African socialism, 
        consciencism and negritude. At best, these ideologies formulation 
        have produced African philosophers on the throne without 
        appreciable inauguration of very articulate modern day 
        governance. Indeed, the situation had always produced systemic 
        motive of philosophising away public funds into accounts. This 
        also led to mystification of political authority as demonstrated by 
        President Mobutu in Zaire. 
        There are, however, enduring democratic values subsumed in 
        traditional political systems in African societies. A good example 
        is that of a two-way communication between the rulers and the 
        people they governed. This was through village square meetings. 
        The political ideals in African political system, when properly fine￾tuned and articulated, could be fused with presidential system. 
        When this will be done in Africa is difficult to prophesy but it is 
        not an illusion to make it happen.`

        title : "What is Religion?",
        content : `
        It is difficult to have an acceptable definition of religion because it 
        is a sensitive phenomenon, which stands for different things among 
        different people. Indeed, religion is defined on the basis of 
        individual conviction, which is the end product of religious 
        experience. In other words, religious experience precedes religious 
        conviction and ultimately religious expression and belief. 
        Religious experience is the practical encounter, which a person has 
        with the ultimate Being or God. This experience provides 
        justification for people’s religious conviction. For example, a man 
        who experiences the goodness of God in one way or the other 
        would express his conviction about the existence of God on the 
        one hand and His goodness on the other. What he expresses as the 
        outcome of his experience, therefore, would become the basis for 
        his religious belief. Religious belief informs religious practices, 
        which are manifested in liturgical activities like singing, dancing, 
        jumping and bowing, among others. In the same vein, somebody 
        else whose encounter is different from the first person would 
        anchor his/her religious beliefs on the basis of his or her religious 
        experience.

        On account of the above, it is not practicable to have a 
        consensus definition of religions. However, for the purpose of this 
        discussion, we can adopt a working one. In this sense, Kenny’s 
        definition of religion is apposite. He defines religion as any system 
        which relates man to ultimate values, whether God or something 
        else, and which embodies a creed, a code, a cult and a communion 
        (Dzurgba 1987: 18). Every religion possesses all the qualities so 
        itemised by Kenny. Besides, other things central to a religion are 
        belief about God or gods, the nature and destiny of man, the 
        meaning of history and the hope for the future.
        With this submission, we can argue that every man has a right 
        to define whatever practices he performs as religion in as much as 
        such falls within the features mentioned above. This is why we 
        have many religions in the world. What A-Z profess or define as 
        religion should be respected by all religious persons in the society. 
        In fact, religion in our society could be likened to a football field, 
        where we have many football players at the two ends and the 
        ambition of every player is to score a ball through a channel the 
        (goal post). Once the ball passes through the channel, it makes a 
        score irrespective of the direction the ball comes from within the 
        field. Thus as earlier indicated, the ultimate aim of every player 
        including the goal keeper is to score through the goal post no 
        matter the direction the ball comes from. The inference we can 
        draw from the illustration is that central to every religion is belief 
        in the existence of God or something supernatural, no matter how 
        each religious person interprets and analyses his/her religious 
        encounter.`

          content : `Religion is a product of culture because it is an integral part of the 
        way of life (like arts and literature) of a people. Since religion has 
        to do with belief system, it is essentially a product of culture, 
        People’s belief arises from the interpretation of things around them 
        (Akonga 2003: 24-25). A systematic reflection and interpretation 
        of what people see around them informs religious encounter, which 
        later translates to religious conviction and ultimately religious 
        beliefs. The religious thinking of a people is reflected in what they 
        say about God. For instance, the people in the riverine areas who 
        experience large expanse of water every day are likely to conclude 
        that God is a God of water. In the same vein, somebody in the 
        forest area is likely to link God to forest. It is in the light of the 
        above, that one could understand the import of the parable of Jesus 
        based on the Lillie and the mustard seeds which are things he saw 
        in his immediate environment and from which he drew reference 
        about the kingdom of God. For us to understand this thesis, we 
        must note that religion is man-made, that is, it is based on man’s 
        projection. For instance, nobody has ever seen God, yet religious 
        people believe that He exists. Nevertheless, what they see around 
        them such as the sun, water and the moon, among others, inform 
        their religious convictions about the existence of God, who is 
        regarded as the architect of those things.

        Africans particularly interpret most things (which are elements 
        of culture) religiously. Thus, because of their physical 
        environment, the people in riverine areas worship water divinities 
        and people who live in mountainous areas worship divinities of 
        mountains like the Òkè-Ìbàdàn in Ibadan and the Olúmọ Rock in 
        Abéòkúta, among others. The above submission implies that 
        culture or perhaps cultural environments shape people’s 
        perception, attitudes, tastes, needs and aspirations, which usually 
        have religious undertone. Seen in this perspective, it can be safely 
        argued that religion evolves from peoples’ culture.
        Nature of African Indigenous Religion
        African Indigenous Religion is the religion which is rooted in 
        African culture. However, some scholars call this religion several 
        other names such as African Traditional Religion (A.T.R.), African 
        Religion, African belief system, African thought and African 
        primal heritage, among others. But the one that gains much 
        currency among these names and which is also used consistently 
        by leading scholars of African religion like Mbiti and Parrinder is 
        African Traditional Religion. We need to understand basic things 
        about the word ‘traditional’. The word does not suggest an archaic 
        or unsophisticated religion as most people believe, but it means 
        religion that has been part and parcel of the customs or way of life 
        of a particular people, precisely African people. It is in the context 
        of the above submission that Christianity and Islam are often 
        referred to as imported religions.
        African Traditional Religion has no historical founder. It is as 
        old as the beginning of humanity. Immediately Africans found 
        themselves on the earth, they began to think, act, behave and hope 
        religiously. The idea of religion came to them in their attempt to 
        provide meanings and interpretations to bewildering questions 
        about man’s destiny and his nature. For example, the Africans 
        ruminated on issues such as how he came into being, who brought 
        him into existence, and what happens to him now and in the future. 
        Upon long pondering, he conceived the idea of religion, which 
        constantly reflects on his day-to-day activities. Mbiti and Idowu 
        maintained that religion permeates all aspects of the life of 
        Africans so fully that ‘it is not easy or possible to isolate it; (Mbiti
        1969). Citing the Yorùbá as an example, Idowu categorically 
        remarks that:
        The religion permeates their life so much that it 
        expresses itself in multifarious ways: it forms the 
        theme of song, makes topics for ministering, finds 
        vehicles in myths, folktales, proverbs and sayings and 
        it is the basis of philosophy (Idowu 1976:6).
        The African Traditional Religious belief features practically in 
        the life of African people from cradle to grave. The theological 
        belief is that everything always has a religious colouration. It is 
        interesting to note that one important feature of the religion is that 
        it does not have scriptures like Christianity and Islam. However, 
        what we know about it could be found in Oral traditions, which 
        contains religious information, passed from mouth to mouth, from 
        one generation to another. This is manifested in myths, legends, 
        proverbs, songs, folktales, folklore, music, liturgy and symbols to 
        mention a few.`

          title : "Essential Beliefs of African Traditional Religion",

        Religion. These are beliefs in God, divinities, ancestors, spirit, 
        African Religion and Culture 45
        magic and medicine, Africans believe in the existence of God who 
        is regarded as self-existing, the Supreme Being, the Creator and 
        Sustainer of the universe and everything including man. Hence, 
        God is given several names and attributes, which vary from one 
        place to another. But people, as a result of previous encounters 
        they had with God, coin those names for Him.
        The nature of the Supreme Deity in ATR, can be seen from the 
        qualities attributed to Him. These correspond generally with many 
        of the divine attributes of God in other religions. To adherents of 
        African Traditional Religion, Deity is Supreme. He is wholly
        other, and is not of the rank and file of the divinities since they are 
        infinitely subordinate to Him. He is called the All-Powerful God 
        and He receives many similar titles—creator, allotter, and giver of 
        rain and sunshine.

        As a creator of all things, the Yorùbá call him Eleda (Creator 
        of Human Beings); Igbo would say Chineke (the spirit that 
        creates), the Edo call him Osanobuwa (the carrier and sustainer of 
        the universe). Creation is not only in the past; the divine work is 
        continued in sustaining the universe. God is regarded as the King. 
        He is the sovereign ruler of the Universe, His will is absolute, and 
        everything in the universe is under His control. God is seen as 
        omnipotent and omnipresent. The whole universe is under His 
        unitary control. For example, the Nupe call God Soko who is 
        believed to be in their front and back. This is to show His presence. 
        For African people, God is mysterious and nobody can understand 
        Him. He creates and destroys. He gives and takes away. He is 
        invisible, infinite and unchangeable.

        As the Judge, the Supreme God is seen as impartial, and 
        transcends all loyalties. He is the final disposer of all things. In 
        addition, the supreme God is conceived as unfathomable. This is 
        why no image of Him is made in Africa. No temple can contain 
        Him since the whole universe is regarded as the face of God. The 
        West Africans sometime feel uncomfortable to worship Him 
        directly. To them, the Deity is incomprehensible, indescribable and 
        incomparable. Another attribute of God is immutability. The belief 
        is that He neither slumbers, nor sleeps, and does not change. For 
        example, the Yorùbá call Him Òyígíyigì Ọba Àìkú – ‘The Mighty, 
        46 J.K. Ayantayo and S.A. Fatokun
        Durable, Immovable Rock that never dies’. This clearly shows the 
        “ever-livingness” of the Deity. The attributes of God as seen above 
        lead to the impression that He is a big God whom nobody has ever 
        seen and therefore cannot be reached except through an 
        intermediary; hence the belief in divinities—the intermediary 
        through which God can be contacted. Divinities are small gods that 
        people worship. They are of different types such as arch divinity, 
        water divinity and messenger divinity among others.
        Belief in ancestors has to do with how Africans interpret life 
        and death. To them, death is not the end of man; rather it is a 
        transition to another world in another plane. On the basis of this, it 
        is believed that a man could live after death in the world of the 
        ancestors especially those who had lived good lives while on earth, 
        left children behind, died at old age, died a good death and were 
        buried very well. The belief is that such persons have capacity and 
        power to look back in order to protect, care for and guide and 
        direct the steps of relatives left behind. It is on this note that Mbiti 
        describes the ancestor as the living dead.
        Another belief is the one relating to spirits. Spirits are 
        apparitional entities that inhabit mostly natural objects such as 
        trees, running water, rock, sun, moon, star, and sand among others. 
        They equally live in some symbolic creatures such as specific birds 
        and animals. Spirits are invisible, but in a few cases, they could 
        make themselves visible especially to people who have “second 
        eyes”. In most cases, they are spoken of as bad spirits with power 
        to harm man; among them are agents of witchcraft, magic, and 
        sorcery. They are believed to be everywhere, which suggests that 
        African continent is a world of spirits. From this impression conies 
        the animistic theory of religion.
        Belief in magic and medicine is also an element of African 
        Indigenous Religion. Magic has to do with manipulation of unseen 
        forces to do one's will. It goes with spellings and incantations of 
        some words in order to invoke unseen spirits to achieve the secret 
        power of making seemingly impossible things to happen. Medicine 
        basically deals with physical manipulation, tapping and exploring 
        of natural resources such as trees and plants to effect healing, 
        curing and preventing diseases and ailment. In some cases, it may 
        be necessary to do magical things to make medicine efficacious. It 
        African Religion and Culture 47
        is important to note that all these five fundamental beliefs so stated 
        above are interrelated. None is inferior or superior as they are all 
        mutually exclusive. African Traditional Religion is replete with 
        ethical values, which ultimately enhance African culture.

        African religion affects the culture of Africa in various ways. We 
        shall highlight this in the light of how the religion enhances 
        societal ethos through what can be called traditional religious 
        ethics. This is derived mainly from oral tradition such as wise 
        saying, Ifá literary corpus among the Yoruba, fable, folktales, 
        proverbs songs music, legend, taboo, myths and so forth.
        The oral traditions express the mind and thought of African 
        people about what constitutes right or wrong, correct or incorrect 
        actions in their traditional milieu. Traditional religious ethics has 
        its source in God while morality originates from religion (Opoku 
        1976: 53)
        Thus, we find what constitutes the moral code of any particular 
        African society in the laws, taboos, customs and set forms of 
        behaviour which derive their compelling power from religion. 
        Thus, morality flows out of religion and through this, the conduct 
        of an individual person is regulated, and any break of the moral 
        code is regarded as evil and punishable.
        Arising from the above thesis is that God is the ultimate source 
        and guardian of a human morality. This is possible because God 
        himself is a moral being and also made man with some qualities in 
        him. It follows that He requires every person to live a virtuous and 
        pure life in both private and public places. Individuals and the 
        entire society are to apply to their daily activities, the following 
        ethical values: love, honesty, dedication, humility, faithfulness, 
        accountability, responsibility, discipline, cooperation, loyalty, 
        justice, obedience, friendliness, compassion, self control, 
        orderliness, patience, endurance and sincerity (Ayantayo 1999: 
        118-135). All these values, according to the Yoruba, constitute 
        ìwà—character. This accordingly includes respect for old age, 
        loyalty to one’s parents and local tradition, honesty in public and 
        private dealings devoting to duty, sympathy and readiness to assist

        Interaction between Christianity and African Culture
        Christianity as a missionary religion was first introduced into 
        Africa directly from Asia, its founding continent in the first (1st) 
        century A.D. Evangelist Mark is acclaimed as the first to have 
        planted Christianity at Alexandria in Egypt before the middle of 
        the first century AD. Some centuries before Islamic jihad, there 
        were great Christian centres in such places as Egypt, Ethiopia, 
        Nubia, Sudan and North Africa, also called “Roman Africa”—a 
        region which comprised of countries known today as Tunisia, 
        Libya, Algeria and Morocco (Fatokun 2011: 19,20).

        However, owing to the thick forest zone and lack of good 
        waterways, West Africa remained unchristianised until the 15th 
        century (Onibonoje 1958). The first attempt at Christianising West 
        Africa came from the Roman Catholic Portuguese missionaries and 
        traders who came to Elmina in Gold Coast in 1462 (Falola and 
        Adeniran 1983: 80). However, this missionary enterprise did not 
        succeed much in planting Christianity in West Africa owing to its 
        connection with Trans-Atlantic slave trade and other miscarriages. 
        The Christianity found today in West Africa owes so much to the 
        19th century Protestant missionary movements from Europe and 
        America which arose as a result of the great evangelical and 
        spiritual awakening that took place in Europe and America in the 
        18th century (Agbeti 1986: 11). The Roman Catholic Church later 
        joined in re-christiansing West Africa by the formation of some 
        Roman Catholic missionary societies. 
        However, researches have unveiled that the exportation of 
        Christianity to Africa brought alongside with it an equal 
        exportation of foreign culture and western civilisation. For 
        instance, Christianity introduced to Africa in modern times from 
        African Religion and Culture 49
        Europe was presented much in European culture and civilisation. 
        Subsequently, there was a kind of cultural interaction between 
        African indigenous culture and European Christian culture. The 
        influence of the two cultures on each other can be seen in the 
        underlisted areas:

          content : `
        (i) Marriage 
        There was interaction between African indigenous culture 
        and European Christian Culture in the area of marriage. The 
        European Christian marriage culture of “one man, one wife” 
        was superimposed on African converts to Christianity. Thus, 
        to be a full church member, and to be eligible for 
        ecclesiastical posts, an African convert to Christianity who 
        was polygamous was required to do “restitution” which 
        involved doing away with his many wives and sticking to just 
        one (in most cases. preferably the first wife). This cultural 
        practice is today highly-questionable in African Christianity. 
        Attempts were made to strip Christianity in Africa of its 
        different European cultural impositions which include 
        monogamy. This consequently led to series of secession from 
        the mission-based churches and the formation of a number of 
        African Independent or Ethiopian Churches (such as The 
        African Church (Bethel), The United African Methodist 
        Church (Ẹlẹja), and United Native African Church (U.N.A.) 
        where polygamy is not regarded as sinful (Ayegboyin and 
        Ishola 1997: 40).

        (ii) Dressing and Language
        European missionaries who came to Africa did not only come 
        to plant Christianity but also to promote European dressing 
        culture. As a result, everything African was written off as 
        barbaric and pagan, and attempts were made to make the 
        African converts to Christianity to adopt European ways of 
        life in dressing and in language, among other areas. Thus, to 
        be truly accepted as a Christian, one must dress in European 
        outfit and must speak the white man's language. In fact, for 
        acceptable worship, African Christians were required to 
        worship God through Christ in European way. Deplorably, 
        50 J.K. Ayantayo and S.A. Fatokun
        this European cultural imperialism still has much effect on 
        many African countries today after several years of 
        independence from the colonial government. Thus, there is 
        still a kind of spiritual or religious colonisation in Africa, 
        several years after the departure of the colonial powers.

        (iii) Education
        Western education was introduced to most parts of Africa, 
        especially Nigeria through the activities of Christian 
        missionaries from Europe and North America (Fafunwa 
        1974). In the long-run, African traditional education system 
        became substituted with Western education system. While 
        this has produced much positive effect in the area of adopting 
        western civilisation and technological development, the rich 
        African cultural heritage and its socio-ethical values have 
        been undermined. Consequently, there is much moral 
        bankruptcy in most of our societies.

        (iv) Modern Medical Facilities 
        Western medicine was introduced to Africa alongside the 
        exportation of Christianity. Christian missions established 
        hospitals and dispensaries as part of their mission strategies. 
        African traditional medicine was condemned as both barbaric 
        and demonic, and was consequently gradually displaced by 
        Western medicine. This situation has, however, changed in 
        recent times with the cultural revival and modernisation of 
        African traditional medicine.

        There is much marriage between Christian burial rites and 
        African traditional rites of Initiation. The act of observing 
        wake-keep has been identified as a Christianisation of African 
        traditional practice. According to Nabofa (1991: 83), 
        traditionally, the dead were buried in the middle of the night 
        or a few hours before dawn. Christian missionaries 
        discouraged and disapproved of this practice as demonic, and 
        instead put forward the practice of meeting in the evening to 
        mourn/celebrate the dead in a Christian way, while real burial 
        African Religion and Culture 51
        was recommended to be done in the morning of the following 
        day. Similarly, Christian remembrance services held for the 
        dead in churches underscore the African traditional belief in 
        the union and communion between the living and the world 
        of ancestors.

        unsatisfying to African religious temperament which was 
        highly characterised by much emotionalism. Interaction 
        between African culture and Euro-American worship culture 
        led to a revolt in culture. Attempts by the mission churches to 
        make “frozen people of God” out of the religiously 
        emotionally Africans led to schism—the product of which 
        was the emergence African indigenous churches (like 
        Cherubim and Seraphim churches, The Church of the LORD 
        (Aládùúrà), Christ Apostolic Church, Celestial Church of 
        Christ, and so on). These churches, unlike the Mission 
        churches incorporated African elements like drumming, 
        dancing, vision, trances, sporadic interjections and prophecies 
        into Christian worship to make the religion enthusiastic and 
        satisfying to African religious temperament (Ayegboyin and 
        Ishola 1997: 24, 25)

        There is a kind of interaction between Christianity and

        One of the distinguishing marks of African Christianity today 
        is the phenomenon of ‘“Warfare” or “Radical prayers” 
        whereby much time is devoted to allegedly combating 
        enemies in “spiritual battle.” Today, African Christians 
        devote much time to praying all sorts of maledictory prayers 
        than spending quality time in praying in the manner 
        advocated in the New Testament standard. This practice, as 
        research unveiled, is more of a revival of African traditional 
        imprecatory prayer pattern with a Christian coloration 
        (making allusions to imprecatory Psalms).

        African Traditional (Indigenous) Religion has impacted upon 
        Christianity in the area of rituals and sacrifices, especially in 
        the African Indigenous Churches. One of the results of this 
        interaction is the Christianised form of African traditional 
        religious rituals and sacrifices found today in what some 
        scholars would call “Syncretic Churches”. This practice is 
        commonly found in the African Indigenous Churches like the 
        Cherubim and Seraphim churches and Celestial Church of 
        Christ. While it is affirmed that these churches are borrowing 
        freely from African Indigenous religious practices, they on 
        their own lay claim to following the Old Testament precepts 
        than borrowing from African Indigenous religious practices.

        While African indigenous culture puts women in subjective 
        position, Western Christianity preaches a doctrine of 
        “equalitarianism”. However, while on the one hand, this 
        emphasis on equality of sexes before God has helped so much 
        in uplifting the status of women, in African society, it is not 
        without its demerits. There is a greater record of broken 
        homes and single parenthood in African societies in modern 
        times than in the traditional African society. Part of the 
        reasons for this is lack of submissiveness on the part of some 
        women to their husbands, on the claim that “we are all equal 
        before God”, whereas the Bible enjoins wives to submit to 
        their husbands as unto the Lord (Ephesians 5:22). African 
        indigenous culture equally upholds submission of wives to 
        their husbands.

          content : `By way of historical emergence, Islam is a seventh (7th) century 
        religion founded by Prophet Mohammed in Saudi Arabia, as a 
        revelation from God. The word “Islam” implies peace” 
        Mohammed emerged as a Prophet to his people sometime around 
        A.D. 610, after one of his series of solitary retreats to a cave in 
        Makkah for religious meditations and prayers (Parrinder 1965: 61). 
        He claimed to have received the words of God through special 
        revelations by Angel Jubril [Gabriel]. He thereafter embarked on a 
        series of spiritual preaching of the new religion in and around 
        Makkah (Falola and Adediran 1983: 3).
        Roughly fifteen years after the death of the holy prophet, his 
        group of followers committed to writing, from memory, his series 
        of teachings, preaching and deeds. This written scripture is given 
        the name Al-Qur’an” (meaning from “memory”—implying a 
        sacred text committed to writing from memory). In the words of 
        Falola and Adediran, the Qur’an is a book of scripture concerned 
        with the relationship of man to man, man to God, laws dealing with 
        marriage customs and inheritance (Falola and Adediran 1983: 40).
        Islam was exported to Africa through trade and conquest 
        before the end of the seventh century A.D. In eagerness to expand 
        the new faith beyond the boundaries of Arabia, and to get more 
        fertile lands to settle, the Arabs embarked on a rigorous and rapid 
        conquest of many places close to their homeland and Africa 
        (Falola and Adediran 1983: 6). Thus, as early as A.D. 640 (barely 
        ten years after the death of the founder), Islam with its missionary 
        zeal had reached Egypt and North Africa (known then as Roman 
        Africa – comprising nations known today as Tunisia. Libya, 
        Algeria and Morocco) through jihad. However, Islam did not 
        penetrate into West Africa until the eleventh century. 
        It is pertinent to note that Islam was introduced to Africa in 
        Arabian culture and civilisation. This new religion with its culture 
        brought about a lot of changes to African indigenous culture. As 
        the two cultures interacted, there was assimilation of Islamic and 
        Arabian culture on the one hand; while on the other hand, there 
        was also what we could call “Africanisation of Islamic culture”. 
        This cultural interaction, which produced Islamisation of African 
        54 J.K. Ayantayo and S.A. Fatokun

        E.G. Babalola (1992: 41), the status of women has undergone 
        some changes with the introduction of Islam. As pointed out 
        by him, Islam was the first to establish a way of life wherein 
        the rights of women were recognised, and a respectable and 
        responsible place in the society was assured for them. He 
        relates that Islam allows women to manage their own affairs 
        where necessary, and say “yes” or “no” in matters, vital to 
        their future life (e.g. marriage); they could inherit property 
        and contribute their quota to the welfare and progress of the

        functionalism was the main guiding principle of African education 
        and that education is a means to an end and not an end in itself. It 
        has been observed that traditional education is holistic in nature 
        and it helps in the realisation of the African culture among other 
        things. Perhaps, it may be regarded as a branch of African culture. 
        Traditional education may be regarded as the African way of 
        imparting their culture into the younger ones in such a way that 
        their culture will not go into an extinction. Traditional education 
        generally begins at home where the parents become the child’s first 
        teachers. The first child’s lesson is teaching about his environment 
        as well as culture of his society including number and numeracy.
        Specifically, African education is geared towards social 
        responsibility, job orientation, political participation as well as 
        spiritual and moral values. There is a proverb in Nigeria that “a 
        child is not intelligent and his parents do not want him to die, what 
        will eventually kill a child who is not intelligent?” This means that 
        traditional education goes beyond acquisition of reading and 
        writing skills. In the pre-literate period of African society, people 
        who were knowledgeable in their vocations, societal ethics and 
        were indeed repositories of the culture of their societies were 
        considered educated. In other words, African traditional education 
        prepares the younger ones for adulthood life in addition to 
        preparing them to become useful members of their society.

        education has its own objectives. Seven of these have been 
        identified by Fafunwa (1974). They are:

        (3) To inculcate respect for elders and those in position of 
        authority;
        (4) To develop intellectual skills;
        (5) To acquire specific vocational training and to develop 
        healthy attitude towards honest labour;
        (6) To develop a sense of belonging and to participate 
        actively in family and community affairs;
        (7) To understand, appreciate and promote the cultural 
        heritage of the community at large.
        African Traditional Education: Nigerian Experience 61
        The first of the objectives listed above is physical training. In 
        receiving physical training, the Nigerian child watches the adults 
        the way they jump, climb and dance. Drumming is one of the 
        Nigerian traditional professions which, apart from being used for 
        entertainment, involves physical exercises. Therefore, the Nigerian 
        child has unlimited access to music with their elders showing them 
        how to drum and take dancing steps.
        Again, traditionally, Nigerians are used to wrestling which help 
        them to exercise themselves physically. As the child grows up, he 
        will be watching the adults and consequently imitate them. By 
        wrestling, the child exercises himself, herself and thus his/her 
        physical development is enhanced.
        The next objective of traditional education is moral, or 
        character training. It should be noted that character training is the 
        primary objective of traditional education. Perhaps, this is why 
        Nigerians always refer to a child who does not have good morals 
        as a child without education. Indeed, Majasan (1967) identified 
        character training and religious education, which according to him 
        aid moral development, as the two major objectives of traditional 
        education not only in Nigeria, but also throughout Africa.

        A child’s character is molded by his/her social environment—
        parents and members of the society. A Nigerian child is expected 
        to be honest, dutiful, respectful, law abiding, loyal, sociable among 
        other things. In all these characteristics, parents serve as models for 
        their children. The home is a major factor of socialisation for the 
        children. When a child misbehaves, he/she is corrected 
        immediately by his parents or adults in the vicinity of the child. 
        For instance, if a child and elders/adults are eating from the same 
        plate, the child is not expected to take a piece of meat before the 
        adults. He/she is not expected to interject when two adults or 
        elderly people are engaged in a discussion. All these characteristics 
        and ways of behaviour are learnt by children at home.
        Peer groups are also involved in child’s character training. This 
        could be through competitive assignments or healthy rivalry 
        among them. Wrestling could also be organised. The introduction 
        of Islamic education which was later brought to Nigeria greatly 
        enhanced the character training of the child as it is against 
        immorality of any kind.
        Again, the use of labour in many places and cases enhanced the 
        child’s character formation. Taboos generally are things one is not 
        supposed to do and if done, may carry some degree of punishment 
        for the taboo breakers. Nobody wants to be a victim of taboo 
        breaking. Because of this fact, a Nigerian child will not like to do 
        anything that will bring curse on him/her. Also, there are many 
        problems and folk tales centre on morals which children learn from 
        their parents.

          content : `
        As a matter of fact, no Nigerian family will want to have a 
        child that will bring disgrace to it. Many Nigerian parents will even 
        prefer to be childless to having a child that will lack character and 
        consequently bring dishonour to them.
        Another objective of traditional education is respect for the 
        elderly people in the society. Traditionally, parents and elders are 
        regarded as custodians of traditions and customs. Therefore, they 
        are held in high esteem. As the Quran and the bible preach, 
        traditional education inculcates respect to elderly people. No 
        Nigerian child that receives traditional education will ever raise up 
        his/her eyes to look at the elderly in the face.
        There are various ways by which the Nigerian child shows 
        respect to the elders and parents. For instance, he/she prostrates/
        kneels down to greet elders and parents at specific periods of the 
        day or as required by circumstances. Again, when an elderly 
        person is carrying something on his head, it is the responsibility of 
        a well trained Yoruba Nigerian child to assist him/her by carrying 
        the thing for him/her. No normal Nigerian child will hide his/her 
        face when he/she sees an adult/elder carrying something on his/her 
        head.
        `},
        {
          title : "",
          content : `
        Another area where a Nigerian child shows respect is when a 
        child is eating with an adult or elder. The elder will be allowed by 
        the child to take a piece of meat before taking his/her own. Also, 
        when adults or elders are discussing, the child will not participate 
        in their discussion unless invited. He/she will only be watching 
        them in order to learn from them.
        Whenever a child or a younger person is going out with elders, 
        it is the moral responsibility of that child to help the elders carry 
        their bags etc. However, it should be noted that under the 
        traditional education, while children respect adults and their 
        parents, they also expect good disposition and appreciation from 
        the elders. The child will want to be recognised, taken care of and 
        be appreciated by the adults. The child will want adults to see 
        his/her role in the society as being complementary to that of adults 
        since both are expected to contribute their quota to the 
        development of the society.

        Another objective of traditional education is intellectual 
        training. Traditional education in Nigeria has a place for the 
        intellectual development of the child. Intellectual education is 
        always acquired through observation, imitation as well as 
        participation. The adults will demonstrate to the child whatever 
        they want the child to put into practice. The child is made familiar 
        with most things in his/her environment, even the history of the 
        environment which he/she may be ignorant of, by the elders in the 
        society.
        The use of proverbs in the Nigerian society also enhances the 
        child's intellectual development. Proverbs may be expressed in 
        different ways, but certainly, they connote the same meaning 
        throughout Nigeria. It is the duty of every Nigerian child to master 
        the proverbs of his/her people and make use of such proverbs very 
        correctly.

        Also, the existence of secret societies or cults in the Nigerian 
        society is another avenue for the child’s intellectual development. 
        The reason for this is that members of such secret societies have 
        their ways of doing things which are different from others. 
        Anybody who is a member is duty bound to master their peculiar 
        languages and other things they do there. With this, intellectual 
        education is being acquired. Perhaps, what can be regarded as 
        higher traditional education can be acquired through the initiation 
        training being given by the traditional professionals such as the 
        herbalists, hunters as well as chiefs and priests. This is also in line 
        with Babarinde (2016). While being initiated, the new members 
        will learn the secrets of the new groups. In some cases, the new 
        members will be expected to recite some incantations and this must 
        be done correctly. Otherwise, it will not work in the way it is 
        expected to work. It should also be noted that there is no 
        community or society in Nigeria that does not have its own 
        peculiar recitations and incantations for different situations. 
        Certainly, this assists the intellectual acquisition of the Nigerian 
        child.

        Again, the use of cowry which involves counting greatly assists 
        the Nigerian child in the area of numeracy. Cowry is not strange to 
        Nigerians as this constitutes some form of currency before the 
        introduction of modern currency. The Nigerian child has to be 
        taught this too. Every community, society or ethnic group has its 
        way of counting, that is, numerical system. Under traditional 
        education, Nigerians have various ways of teaching their children 
        addition, subtraction, multiplication as well as division of things. 
        In the farms, the Nigerian child is exposed to various ways of 
        adding, subtracting and multiplication of things as they talk of 
        number of heaps that can make an acre.
        Finally, in the Nigerian traditional education, there are a 
        number of games which involve counting. One of such games is 
        that which teaches addition, subtraction, multiplication as well as 
        division. By participating in Ayo game, a child is expected to be 
        good in counting, otherwise, he will always be disgraced by other 
        players. Every ethnic group or society or community has its own 
        peculiar game that enhances teaching and learning of calculations. 
        Generally speaking, traditional education prepares an individual 
        for appropriate skills which will assist them to be self employed 
        later in life.`

        the child’s naming ceremony, all members of the family as well as 
        other well wishers will be in attendance. The child’s education in 
        Nigeria always starts when the child is very young like it happens 
        in the other countries of the world. At the initial stage, the child 
        will be closer to the mother than any other person. This closeness 
        may continue till perhaps the age of six years. The reason being 
        that at this stage, the mother is saddled with the responsibility of 
        African Traditional Education: Nigerian Experience 65
        rearing the child. In most cases, the father is not always at home, 
        the mother sees it as her own responsibility to stay at home in 
        order to give the child a befitting education that will not bring 
        disgrace to the parents and the entire family in the future.
        Every older member of a traditional society participates in the 
        rearing of a child. In other word, every elderly person in a 
        traditional society is a child’s teacher. The teaching method under 
        traditional education is the personal involvement of the child in the 
        teaching and learning as well as the practice of what the child has 
        been taught. Traditional education is generally informal and 
        practical. It should be noted however, that the stage or level and 
        degree of participation in the child’s education may vary from one 
        society to another. The child watches the mother from whom 
        he/she learns the language of his/her immediate environment. The 
        mother understands the needs of her child. She knows why her 
        child is happy or unhappy she tries to satisfy the needs of her child. 
        Consequently, the closest person to the child at the initial stage is

        Under the traditional system of education, the child belongs to 
        everybody in the family and not to his/her biological parents only. 
        Thus, in Yoruba land, a child is always called “our child” and not 
        “my child”. In addition to other responsibilities of the mother, she 
        is the first agent of her child’s socialisation, it is through her that 
        the child is aware of his/her immediate environment. Perhaps, this 
        may be why the child’s first language is always called “mother 
        tongue” and not “father or family tongue”.
        Whenever a child is put in charge of the elders to be looked 
        after particularly when the mother is engaged, this will be an 
        opportunity for the elders to contribute their own quota to the 
        training of the child. The child could be beaten by them if he/she 
        does not take to their instruction. They teach the child the local 
        language with the aid of various objects for the child to play with. 
        It should be stated here that methods of learning under traditional 
        education include imitation, participation, among others. 
        Gradually, the child begins to master his/her local language as well 
        as the culture of his/her people. As the child grows up, he/she is 
        knowledgeable in the language and cultural practices of his/her

        members of the extended family could be in form of telling the

        Traditional training is always acquired through the system of 
        apprenticeship. In most cases, parents send their children to their 
        friends to serve as apprentices for the purpose of acquiring a 
        particular vocational skill. The number of years spent on acquiring 
        skills depends largely on the type of profession, the apprentice's 
        good disposition and learning ability and the relationship existing 
        between him and his master. It is believed that if an apprentice 
        serves his master very diligently, he will certainly be taught well 
        by the former. Parents do not always allow their children to learn 
        under them to ensure proper discipline. This, however, is not the 
        general rule as there are exceptions. The exceptions are farming 
        and certain family based vocations such as carving etc.
        In learning agricultural profession, children in most cases, 
        work directly under their parents. Parents give training to their 
        children right from childhood. Boys go with their fathers to the 
        farm while the girls stay with their mothers at home in other to 
        learn their professions. Initially, they watch and observe their 
        fathers as well as their senior ones. As the boys grow up, they are 
        engaged in less tedious work such as weeding. On reaching the age 
        of adulthood or when they are adjudged old enough, they join their 
        fathers in all aspects of farm work. It should be noted that there is 
        no formal learning here since in most cases children follow the 
        footsteps of their parents.

        On trade and crafts, parents send their children to their friends

        children are apprentices under parents, the training will not be 
        thorough. In most cases, while boys are always apprenticed to 
        men, girls on the other hand are always apprenticed to women. 
        This does not, however, mean that in a few cases, girls cannot be 
        apprenticed to men and vice versa. In the Nigerian society, some 
        vocations belong to girls only while some are solely for the boys. 
        There are vocations also for both boys and girls. Usually, boys 
        learn their father’s vocation.
        Training to become a priest, a diviner or a traditional medical 
        doctor involves the process of learning under a master. A man who

        parents as well as relations.

        whenever there is a marriage ceremony, naming ceremony as well

        marriage, naming as well as burial ceremonies.
        The African traditionalists lay greater emphasis on respect for 
        elders as well as constituted authorities. Perhaps, no other form of 
        education lays emphasis on respect more than traditional 
        education. Male children will prostrate while greeting, the female 
        children will kneel down while greeting elders. Whenever elders 
        and children are eating together as stated earlier, the younger ones 
        will be cautious in taking a piece of meat. Whenever elders are

        display or participate in all things concerning the community.

        On the other hand, if civilisation is accepted to be an advanced

        human society, then, it may be argued that informal education to 
        some extent has been negatively affected due to western 
        civilisation brought by improved technology and science.
        The contact of Nigerian culture with that of foreign culture has 
        made it difficult for traditional education to have its primary 
        objectives achieved fully. For instance, many children in the

        traditional society is no longer a thing of joy in many traditional 
        homes as many Nigerian parents prefer teaching their children how 
        to speak English to their mother tongue.
        The shrines which used to play host to many Nigerians in the

        their acceptance of Islam or Christianity. The traditional 
        professions which children used to acquire through traditional 
        methods are now being acquired through modern methods, which 
        could be semi-formal or formal. This is also as a result of contact 
        with the modern world. Many villages and rural areas, unlike in the 
        past, now have electricity, pipe-borne water, which make such

        Also, the era of incantations, concoctions, herbs and traditional 
        medicine is dying gradually. The reason is that there are hospitals 
        in every part of Nigeria including rural areas or villages. Many 
        Nigerians want to move with time and as such, they prefer going to 
        the hospital or medical doctors rather than consulting the 
        traditional herbalists for the treatment of any diseases.
        Unlike in the past, the children of today are very inquisitive 
        and very challenging. The period when they will be told something 
        by the elders or their parents without challenging them is over. 
        These days, if you tell them something, you must be ready to 
        defend it or prepare to answer questions from the children. Also, 
        there is an improvement in both communication and transportation 
        systems. Many traditional Nigerians find it difficult to trek to far 
        places since there are cars, lorries, aeroplanes and ships through 
        which they can travel. Unlike in the past when signs would be used 
        to send messages to people, these days, there are land phones, 
        mobile phones, among others through which Nigerians can get in 
        touch with one another.
        As at today, no Nigerian parent has any constitutional power to 
        treat his/her child just anyhow. Any child who has attained 
        eighteen years of age can drag his/her parents to the court if he/she 
        is pressed to the wall. In the past, children who did not want to be 
        cursed by their parents will never attempt that kind of a thing.
        Also, children and their parents can practice different religions 
        these days. Husbands and wives can equally practice different 
        religions and nothing will happen. Juniors and seniors within the 
        same family can disagree and later agree. Wives and husbands can 
        disagree, while children and their parents can also disagree and 
        later agree, heaven will not fall because of this.
        Finally, the degree of immorality among the Nigerian children 
        these days cannot be compared with what it used to be in the past. 
        This is not unconnected with the African's contact with the foreign 
        culture.`

        Traditional education has many features and one of such 
        features is age group associations. The division of members into 
        age group varies from one place to another. Under traditional 
        education, age is associated with respect, wisdom and it also gives 
        certain social and economic privileges to the people who are 
        considered to be elderly.
        Traditional education is geared towards self employment. It 
        equips members with skills for many vocations which include; 
        farming, weaving, smithing, carving, painting and decorating, 
        carpentry, barbing, drumming hunting, dress making, hair plaiting, 
        soap making, mat-making among others.

        Under traditional education, the children will be exposed to 
        societal beliefs, rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices, annual festivals

        integration of the young members into the society. However, the 
        contact of Nigerian culture with that of foreign culture has made it 
        difficult for traditional education to have its objectives fully 
        achieved. For instance, many children in the Nigerian society these 
        days do not know how to greet people generally. Also, the mother 
        tongue which used to be a pride of every traditional society is no 
        longer fashionable and acceptable in many traditional homes. The

        The Phoenicians had settled among these people, establishing 
        trading settlements. One of these trading posts was Carthage, the 
        most important of all Phoenician settlements, and the one which 
        played the most significant roles in the Roman African civilisation.
        The Carthaginians were Phoenicians who left their home at 
        Tyre in the Eastern Mediterranean at about 1000BC to establish 
        Carthage as a trading city. The original site of Carthage was the 
        site of modern Tunis, Tunisia, in North Africa. As early as the 11th
        Century the Phoenicians had had trading settlements on the coasts 
        of North Africa. These settlements expanded to colonies and by the 
        5th Century BC the colonies had become more stabilised and 
        Carthage had emerged as the most prominent of these. Rome 
        transformed from a minor settlement to a world power, with 
        empire covering almost all the then known world, and Rome, 
        herself, as the capital. Vergil and Livy provide the mythical 
        background to the foundation of Rome by tracing the foundation to 
        the descendants of the hero, Aeneas, who fought in the Trojan War 
        with the Greeks, as recorded in the Iliad of Homer. Romulus, a 
        legendary founder, in line with the Roman tradition, established 
        Rome around the year 753 BC, led by a succession of seven kings 
        in the early decades, the city grew to become one of the greatest 
        civilisations known to history. The Romans came in to annex 
        North Africa after a series of wars with the Carthaginians with the
        eventual destruction of Carthage, following the third Punic War in 
        the year 146 BC. The essential period of the Roman presence in 
        North Africa is, approximately, from about the 5th Century BC to 
        the 5th Century AD although the impacts endure and can still be 
        seen in the science, medical and legal fields, among several others, 
        mostly through the British Empire, Pax Britannica, modelled on 
        the previous Pax Romanam. Today, we still study the Roman law 
        while the laws of several countries are based on it. This chapter 
        examines the impacts of the Romans on the indigenous people of 
        North Africa in areas such as culture, politics, economy, 
        socialisation, religion, customs, language and education.

        Rome was a small town founded around the river, Tiber in Italy 
        around the year 753 BC, according to legend. The natives spoke 
        Latin and known to have settled there as early as 1000BC from the 
        Balkan Peninsula, crossing the Adriatic Sea and they were Indo￾European. Rome was able to grow from a small settlement to an 
        Empire which controlled the whole of Italy, then Europe to Africa 
        and Arabia. The Roman Empire in the east reached the river 
        Euphrates; in the west to the Atlantic ocean; in the South as far as 
        the Sahara desert and in the north to the Rhine. The myths of the 
        foundation of Rome report that a virgin, Rhea Silvia, was raped by 
        the Roman god of war, Mars, became pregnant and gave birth to a 
        set of twins; Romulus and Remus. Reaching manhood, about the 
        year 753 BC, the twins decided to establish a new town. However, 
        they fell into a quarrel as to which of them should be the first ruler 
        of the new settlement. They fought and Romulus killed Remus to 
        become the first ruler of Rome with the new town named after 
        him. This town grew rapidly, expanding to the sea, up to the 
        Apennines, covering the area inhabited by the Volscians and the 
        Etruscans. By 265 BC the Romans had managed to become the 
        mother of the whole of the Italian peninsula south of Po. During 
        the first period of Rome’s development, 753-509, Rome became a 
        great city with kings. The second period, 509-27BC, saw Rome as 
        a Republic after the expulsion of the last king Tarquinus Superbus. 
        During the third period, 27BC – AD 476, Rome was a great

        The indigenous population, mainly the Berbers, are referred to in 
        literature with Latin terms such as gens, natio, populus and ethnos. 
        The natives were mostly nomadic before the Phoenicians and semi 
        nomadic when the Romans arrived. Some of the major indigenous 
        tribes are the Nasomanians, the Psylii, the Maces, the Machlyes, 
        the Auses, the Gindanes, the Garumantes, the Austuriani, the 
        Arzuges, the Zuphones, the Asphodelodes, the Micatanes, the 
        Acacides, among several others. The nationalities of North Africa 
        became more recognised by the period of the 2nd Punic War, 218-
        202 BC, when three notable kingdoms dominated the affairs of 
        North Africa: the Massylii, ruled by king Masinissa; the Masaesylii 
        of king Syphax in Numidia; and the Mauri in Mauretania with king 
        Baga.Massinissa, during the 2nd Century BC, expanded his 
        territory to cover some reasonable parts of the Masaesylii lands 
        thereby forming a united kingdom of Numidia. The last king of 
        Numidia, Juba I, ruled till 46 BC when Julius Caesar annexed 
        Numidia making it a part of the Roman Province, Africa Nova. 
        The kingdom of Mauretania, however, was not annexed to Rome 
        until AD 40. By 108 BC, the Mauri and the Masaesyliihad 
        disappeared, leading to the emergence of the Gaetuli. The Gaetuli 
        is the common name of many culture groups such as the 
        Musulamii, Cinithii, Nybgenii, the Numidae, among several others, 
        who had merged mainly for security purpose. These people were 
        nomadic during the time of Phoenician settlements and the 
        establishment of Carthage. Later, during the Roman occupation 
        most of the population became more settled though at the 
        beginning of the Roman occupation they were semi nomadic. The 
        Romans occupied, conquered and resettled most of the indigenous 
        communities. At the time of the Roman occupation of North 
        Africa, according to Ilevbare, the North African nationalities could 
        be divided into three groups; the subdued within the Roman 
        Province, the unsubdued within the frontier and those outside the 
        76 Idowu Mojeed Alade
        frontier. By the time of the Severi, 193-235 AD, the Romans had 
        the largest of any foreign domination of North Africa before the 
        Arabs occupation of the 7th Century AD.

        The Phoenicians were the seamen of Tyre and Sidon, merchants 
        from Syria and Palestine, very knowledgeable about the sea, very 
        wealthy and highly adventurous. They started trading on the Syrian 
        coast, throughout Asia and Egypt and had settlements and 
        establishments on the coast of Sicily and Spain. Thus, after several 
        years, the Phoenicians had dominated the Western Mediterranean 
        and only the Greeks made any futile attempt to rival them. They 
        were the first known to have visited the indigenous people of 
        North Africa. They had several settlements in Utica in North 
        Africa; Gades, in the Atlantic coast of Spain; and at Abdera and 
        Sexi, on the Mediterranean coast. Carthage was the trading centre 
        for all merchants and caravans from the African countryside. The 
        Carthaginians were, therefore, very wealthy. Established about the 
        year 814 BC as a Phoenician trading town on the coast of North 
        Africa, Carthage was originally an ally of Rome. Already, before 
        the wars with the Romans, the Carthaginians had in their city 
        people from Egypt, Libya, Greece, Spain and Numidia. While the 
        Carthaginians controlled the trades in the ports of Africa and 
        Sardinia, Rome controlled the trading in Latium and Italian coasts. 
        Carthage became so powerful, conquering other surrounding 
        territories.

        The Greeks also founded cities in south Italy, Sicily and 
        Syracuse, on the coast of France. While the Phoenicians and the 
        Greeks traded with the natives thus, the Etruscans also sailed the 
        seas and traded. The Etruscans were the neighbours of the Latin 
        who later ruled Rome for more than 200 years. The last of the 
        Etruscans kings, as hinted above, Tarquinius Superbus, Tarquinius 
        the Proud, was overthrown around 510 BC, beginning the Roman 
        Republic. The Romans had treaties and businesses with the 
        Phoenician town of Carthage while Carthage dominated the trades 
        with Spain and Sicily. Carthage became the lord of North Africa; 
        Carthaginian military power was mainly on the sea while the 
        Roman power was on land. Soon, economic interests brought the 
        Carthaginians against the Romans. The first dispute was caused by 
        their interests in Sicily about 264 BC. Sicily was contested by the 
        Greeks, the Romans and the Carthaginians. The Greek king 
        Pyrrhuswas, however, forced out of Sicily leaving it for both the 
        Romans and the Carthaginians. The Romans eventually fought the 
        Carthaginians for the possession of Sicily, won and became the 
        lords of the entire West. This war began in 264 and ended in 241 
        BC lasting 24 years, known as the first Punic War. The 
        Carthaginian General at the First Punic War was Hamilcar Barca, 
        father of the famous Hannibal. The first invasion of Africa by the 
        Romans was in the year 256 and it ended in a defeat for the 
        Romans in the year 255 when the Roman consul, Regulus, was 
        taken prisoner by the Carthaginians and later tortured to death. 
        However, in the year 241, the Romans succeeded in building a 
        great fleet which defeated the Carthaginians. By one of the terms 
        of reference in the agreement between the Romans and the 
        Carthaginians, the Romans took over the disputed Sicily. The 
        Carthaginians were also forced to pay, within 10 years, a total of 
        about 3,200 talents as indemnity to Rome. Thus, Rome won the 
        First War, and four years later the Romans took over the islands of 
        Corsica and Sardinia.

        The second Punic War began in March 218 BC when the 
        Romans declared war on the Carthaginians on account of the town, 
        Saguntum, an ally of Rome. The Carthaginian General, Hannibal, 
        from his base in Spain, defeated the Roman armies in several 
        encounters within Italy and succeeded in conquering several 
        communities. Hannibal wanted revenge for the Roman possession 
        of Sicily. He raised a great army, crossed the Alps and attacked the 
        Romans, destroying three Roman armies. In 204 BC Scipio 
        Africanus made use of a Roman army in Spain and invaded Africa 
        while Hannibal was still in Italy and could not defend Carthage. 
        This invasion forced the Carthaginians to sue for peace. Hannibal 
        was already in Italy for some 16 years, he returned to Carthage to 
        save his county but Scipio Africanus defeated him at the battle of 
        Zama in 202BC. Carthage, thereafter, became a subject of Rome; 
        and at the end of the second Punic War, Carthage was fined 10,000 
        talents to be paid in 30 years, Spain was taken from her and the 
        Carthaginian naval fleet was reduced to 10. Rome also took over 
        all the Carthaginians’ colonies in North Africa and Carthage was 
        compelled to become a Roman ally by the end of 201BC. 
        Hannibal, before his defeat, had already roused the Greeks to 
        attack Rome. The Romans defeated the Macedonians as well as the 
        armies of the Greek king of Syria and Asia Minor. The Romans 
        also took over the government of Egypt. Within the next 53 years, 
        the Romans were in charge of almost the whole of the then known 
        world. In 149 BC the Romans once again declared war on 
        Carthage, and the Carthaginians, already weakened, surrendered 
        unconditionally, with little or no efforts at resistance. The Romans 
        then requested the Carthaginians to destroy Carthage and move 
        elsewhere, ten miles inland, since Carthage was very close to the 
        coast. The Carthaginians, however, refused. This led to the Third 
        Punic war which lasted for about three years when P. Scipio 
        Aemelianus Africanus defeated Carthage. Carthage was then 
        completely destroyed while the survivors, mostly children and 
        women, surrendered. The original site of Carthage then was made 
        a Roman Province. These former Carthaginian territories were 
        maintained, without further expansion, into the hinterland until the 
        reign of Augustus when the Romans began, once again, their 
        interest on expansion for political and economic interests. Now, 
        the indigenous people, without the control of their kings, and with 
        the Carthaginians vanquished, became so free that they would not 
        easily succumb to the Romans’ domination. The Romans craved 
        the lands but the indigenous people refused and there ensued series 
        of military campaigns to subdue the natives. There were several 
        revolts by the indigenes to put off the Roman yokes with most 
        unsuccessful. Tacitus mentions the case of Tacfarinas, a chieftain 
        among the Numidiae, who deserted from the Roman army, 
        championed a revolt, beginning from the 17 AD, and insisted that 
        there would be no peace until the Emperor Tiberius provided the 
        much needed land for himself and his followers. The indigenous 
        people of Mauretania also revolted after the death of Emperor 
        Trajan and in AD 40 when Emperor Caligula annexed Mauretania.

        The revolt was repressed in AD 44 and Mauretania was then

        Roman civilisation in Africa was mainly economic since the 
        economy of Rome, in the first few centuries after foundation, 
        between 800-300 BC, was essentially agrarian. Originally, the city 
        spread about five miles but later expanded to about 35 miles 
        through conquests of the neighbouring communities. When Rome 
        conquered any territory, the land was acquired and the people 
        enslaved. However, about the time of the second Punic War, the 
        pattern of political strategy of Rome changed to conferment of 
        Roman citizenship, cives Romani, on the conquered people, 
        assimilating them. The Roman North Africa spread from the 
        Greater Syrtes to the Atlantic, covering Tripolitania, Tunisia, 
        Algeria, Western Libya and Morocco. Numidia, one of the most 
        prominent Berber towns, was an ally of Rome as early as 151 BC 
        and when Masinnisa, Numidian king, died in 148BC he left his 
        kingdom in charge of Rome to be divided among his three heirs. 
        Jugurtha, one of them, later became the sole ruler. When Jugurtha 
        murdered Adherbal he also murdered a number of Roman traders 
        with him. This, among other reasons, made the Roman Senate 
        declare war on Jugurtha, annexing that part of North Africa.

        When the Phoenicians first got to North Africa, the indigenous 
        people were organised based on tribal affiliations. Though this was 
        not the arrangement throughout North Africa, however, the 
        patterns of organisations were very similar depending on whether a 
        people were nomadic, sedentary or semi-nomadic. Usually, at the 
        head of a community was a tribal chief or king, as the case may be. 
        This head acted as the administrative and military leader, restricted 
        to a single family whose eldest would be the automatic leader of 
        the town. After the head chief was the undecimprimi, (also known 
        as the principiseniores) the Eleven Leaders. These leaders formed 
        the inner cabinet of the head chief and played more important roles 
        than the general council. Third, in order of importance, was the 
        gerusia, the expanded council of elders, playing advisory role. 
        Members would normally be heads of each family, the oldest 
        member of each extended family. Finally, the general assembly, 
        assembly of all male adults, summoned to discuss and disseminate 
        important decisions. Thus, the indigenous North African govern￾ment was that of an aristocracy of powerful chiefs and family 
        heads who governed their own people, with a king or head chief as 
        the head of the council. The Carthaginians brought about changes 
        in the political organisations of the indigenous North Africans 
        through colonisation, association and indirect influences. The 
        Phoenician system of governance had been enshrined in 
        Phoenician settlements as early as the 5th Century BC. First two 
        sufets, elected annually, were the leaders of government, supported 
        by a council of elders, 30 in number; then a council of 104 judges, 
        and the general assembly. Masinissa, Syphax and Baga, the 
        indigenous chiefs who all reigned during the 3rd Century BC, had 
        their towns modelled on Carthage while the elites of North Africa 
        married Carthaginian women. The natives adopted the two annual 
        sufets and also divided the general assembly into voting sections, 
        following the Carthaginian example. King Masinnisa introduced a 
        legal system patterned on the Carthaginians with a council of 
        judges, whereas, before the adoption of the Carthaginian 
        civilisation, all legal disputes were resolved, informally, at the 
        family and tribal levels.

        The Romans had the advantage of building on the existing 
        Carthaginian’s civilisation and the political acumen of indigenous 
        kings. They inherited the Carthaginian territories, suppressed 
        various revolts, and forced all the nomads and the semi-nomads 
        into sedentary life (though a few still managed to continue their 
        nomadic life style). Once subdued, a military dictator would be put 
        in charge, with troops at his command, to serve as sole 
        administrator saddled with civil and military responsibilities of 
        maintaining peace, law and order as well as collection of taxes for 
        the government. The Romans then imposed a government 
        structured on the Roman pattern of local government. For other 
        more difficult communities, they introduced the indirect form of 
        government where the chief, principes, was left in charge of his 
        own people but reporting to the Romans, assisted by an inner 
        council, principiseniores, then the general council of elders, 
        seniores. A number of the tribes in Mauretania also had to be 
        governed by indirect rule with the Head chiefs maintaining some 
        sort of freedom. This includes the Baquates, the Macenites and the 
        Bavares, among others. The forests and the mountains as well as 
        the courage of the natives made the penetration of those tribes 
        extremely difficult for the Romans, hence, the recourse to Roman 
        diplomacy to govern such.

        North African indigenous population were mainly farmers before 
        the arrival of the Phoenicians. They were nomadic herdsmen and 
        semi sedentary agriculturists. The farmers grew wheat and olives. 
        There were evidence of irrigation system in the valleys of 
        Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Trading activities brought the 
        Phoenicians originally to North Africa, trading with the natives, 
        mostly trade by barter. Herodotus speaks about the silent barter 
        practiced by the natives and the Phoenician traders. The 
        Phoenicians came for gold, corn, copper, ivory and hides. They 
        gave arms, wine and vases, among others, in exchange. The 
        natives, especially the nobles, who enjoyed some sort of 
        monopoly, were also involved in trans-Saharan trade. The 
        economy was simple and the agriculture was subsistence. Most 
        items needed were home-made. Tools and equipment were 
        fabricated by some craftsmen. The craftsmen had this knowledge 
        as part of the family heritage. Before the advent of the 
        Phoenicians, urban life had existed in Mauretania with many towns 
        such as Tamuda, Volubilis, Tingi, Thrinkle, Babba, and many 
        others flourishing. When the Phoenicians arrived, they came with 
        more robust agricultural practices and more organised economical 
        activities. When Carthage conquered territories, they forced the 
        native nomads to settle down as farmers cultivating barley and 
        wheat. The conquerors engaged in cash crops while the natives 
        specialised in cereals. The natives then paid taxes to the 
        Carthaginian government of one fourth of their produce. The 
        agricultural revolution of this period led to great development and 
        the emergence of large towns and communities. The economy 
        became more and more complex with advanced trading method. 
        Carthage had metal workers during the 3rd Century BC fabricating 
        arms, axes, knives, spoons, hooks, farm equipment and other 
        items. Carthaginian traders brought tin from Spain, iron from Elba 
        and gold from Sudan. There were industries engaged in clothing, 
        tie and dye, leather work, and others. The general emphasis was on 
        settled farming as the sedentary farmers were easier to control than 
        the nomads and the semi nomads. With Carthage and the 
        Phoenicians, the natives began to expand their economic activities. 
        Greek, Phoenician and African artisans: welders, sculptors, 
        blacksmiths, metal workers and carpenters came to North Africa. 
        In this way, the coming of the Phoenicians brought great changes 
        into the lives of the North Africans. Africans and Phoenicians 
        worked together, with Africans learning from them and then, 
        gradually, replacing them. There were also improvements in 
        production of equipment and tools, following more advanced 
        Phoenician technology. By the end of the 3rd Century BC, king 
        Syphax had had coins minted for facilitation of trade; and king 
        Massinisa followed later with his own coins. Through this, trade by 
        batter gave way for monetary transactions.

        The economy of North Africa was, therefore, well established, 
        through the Phoenicians, when the Romans came. Agriculture was 
        at the optimum level during this period. The Roman traders started 
        coming in as early as the end of the 2nd Punic war. King Masinissa 
        of Numidia and King Baga of Mauretania invested immensely on 
        agriculture and commercial activities, which also attracted the 
        Italian traders. Rich Romans likewise invested on a large scale in 
        North Africa agriculture. These Romans were mainly interested in 
        wheat and barley cultivation. The peasant African farmers would 
        cultivate and pay their taxes to Rome as they had paid to the 
        Carthaginians in the past. Cereal, olive, wine and ivory were the 
        major agricultural products exported from Africa, supplying Rome, 
        Italy, the Mediterranean and others. There was also the marble 
        trade which continued till the 4th Century AD. Greek sculptors 
        were employed who taught Africans how to carve with marbles. 
        Most of the military posts of the Romans soon became settlements 
        and developed into towns with local municipal government. This 
        also led to urbanisation and constructions of roads. With good 
        network of roads, trading activities were promoted. Carts were 
        used as means of transportation and, as soon as a town is subdued, 
        Italian and Roman traders followed with trading activities. People 
        grew richer and cities became more prosperous under the Roman 
        economic system. Poor people rose up the social ladder.

        Before the Phoenicians came to North Africa the natives had had 
        very little contacts with the outside world. Family unit was the 
        basis of the society and it was an extended family structure. The 
        community was made up of families where only adult male took 
        part in the assembly. Polygamous was the norm with each man 
        having many wives, as many as ten and above, depending on the 
        social status of the man, wealth and possession of land. The 
        economy was subsistence which necessitated a large family. 
        Women stayed at home to perform household duties and to take 
        care of the home. They also assisted in taking care of the herds and 
        the crops when necessary. Wealth included wives, children, flocks 
        and lands. Women, concubine or not, were important on account of 
        their role as the producers of children. Upon the death of the 
        husband, another man of the household would take her as his wife. 
        The children thereafter would be seen as the children of the late 
        husband. Girls were married very early, with bride price and 
        fertility rites, they were supposed to be virgins at that early age, 
        and had no choice in the man they married. With the coming of the 
        Phoenicians, however, there was the class of the nobles, 
        landowners, aristocrats, merchants, upper class and the artisans/ 
        labourers lower class. The society was led by the capitalists and the 
        priests while other citizens, including the slaves, were below. The 
        natives and the Phoenicians intermarried, producing Libo-
        Phoenicians. This mixed blood began to introduce monogamy, as 
        practiced by the Phoenicians. Extended families started collapsing 
        for the nuclear ones. All the North Africans, especially the nobles, 
        since they had much more contact with the Carthaginians, 
        emulated the newly-introduced nuclear family structure. They 
        embraced Carthaginians custom. The semi-nomadic Africans, 
        becoming more sedentary, built houses as was at Carthage and by 
        the time of the destruction of Carthage, the Carthaginian custom 
        prevailed.
        The Roman’s destruction of Carthage was followed by a 
        gradual replacement of the Phoenician’s influence in the socio￾cultural domination of North Africa. The Romans made civil and 
        military careers opened to Africans, thus an improvement in the 
        socio-economic status of Africans. By the 2nd Century BC social 
        classes had existed more clearly, with the nobles on the one hand 
        and the commoners on the other. The most Romanised Africans 
        were the most civilised and the noblest as well as the wealthiest. 
        These rich lived large; they employed labours and had slaves, 
        living exactly as the native Romans. The lower class were about 85 
        per cent of the population even during the period of the zenith of 
        prosperity for the Roman Africans and the peak of Roman 
        civilisation in Africa between the 2nd and the 3rd Centuries AD. 
        The lower class were very poor, living in villages, mostly on their 
        small farms. Many had to serve on the farms of the upper class just 
        like slaves. Only the artisans of the commoners managed to live in 
        towns.

        Adapting and adopting the Carthaginian system when 
        convenient, the Romans also intermarried with Africans giving 
        birth to hybridae. The Italian traders formed an association named 
        conventuscivium Romanorum. Later, the natives and the settlers 
        began to associate, forming such association as conventuscivium 
        Romanorumet Numidarum qui Mascululae habitant, association of 
        Romans and Numidians residing at Mascula, and many other 
        associations. These activities also led to intermarriages which 
        produced hybridae, half castes, hence social fusion and 
        Romanisation of the natives. In fact, the hybridae were the very 
        first set of people in Africa to qualify for the Roman citizenship. 
        With the Romans, monogamy was compulsory though only the 
        Roman citizens could contract such legal marriages while natives 
        who were not citizens could only cohabit. The extended families 
        became more nuclear in nature while urbanisation and 
        individualism prevailed. People were more and more self-centred. 
        Adult male would then leave their extended family to live 
        somewhere else with the nuclear family; a form of perceived 
        freedom and independence. The need for the traditional Africans 
        extended family structure was fast disappearing; agriculture was 
        far more complex than the hitherto subsistence one. Romanisation 
        went hand in hand with urbanisation and civilisation. The cities 
        adopted the Roman constitution. Marriages were still arranged by 
        parents though, at a later date, the girls, mostly from the upper 
        class, were able to choose their spouses for themselves for they had 
        begun to attend schools outside the houses thereby meeting men.

        Twelve became the minimum age for girls to marry in line with the 
        Roman law and marriages were now conducted according to 
        Roman convention. For instance, in the traditional African system 
        men would pay the bride price but in the Roman system the wives 
        would pay dowry to the husbands. Common trends in marriages, 
        however, persist. Practices such as the couples paying respect to 
        the household gods. Roman law made birth registration 
        compulsory within 30 days of birth. Children out of wedlock were 
        considered bastards. Roman law introduced the preparation of 
        “will” which was never a part of the African indigenous system. 
        The council of elders would usually distribute the properties of the 
        deceased. As a result of the Roman influences and general 
        evolution of the North African society family bonds and ties were 
        no longer strong. Divorce, hitherto unknown, became rampant. 
        Many marriages were now arranged merely for political and 
        economic advantages. Women were no longer within the 
        household but in the public contesting with men in businesses, 
        performing religious and social functions. Roman civilisation and 
        education had altered their status. The elite women of the upper 
        class were equal to their husbands, and, by the end of the 2nd 
        Century AD, Roman values had dominated, almost completely, 
        Roman Africa. Women started to gain more freedom while the 
        men began to lose theirs. This situation continued until Christianity 
        came to assert the rights of the husbands over their wives, as in the 
        traditional African culture. Nevertheless, traditional African values 
        and practices persisted among the lower class and the less 
        educated. They continued the old traditional method of marriages, 
        including the extended family structure and polygamy. This 
        situation continued among the peasants till the 5th Century AD.

        The indigenous North African religion before the Phoenicians and 
        the Romans occupations was difficult to describe but evidence 
        suggests that they must have sacrificed to the sun and the moon as 
        symbols of the duality of Divinity. This cult of the sun was further 
        symbolised by a ram crowned with a solar disc and worshipped as
        Ammon-Re which was probably another version of the Egyptian 
        god, Ammon-Ra. Ammon-Re was a god of prophesy, an oracular 
        god; a god of justice, nature and agriculture. Represented by the 
        ram at inception, this god later evolved from the ram-god to purely 
        sun-god by the 5th Century BC. Besides, the North Africans had 
        other gods and goddesses reminiscent of the Greek gods Athena, 
        Triton, Poseidon, Mars and Jupiter. There were, for example, the 
        god of war, Gurzil, represented by a bull; and Mastina, African 
        Jupiter. There were also some indications of animal worship, no 
        doubt representation of some natural forces; snakes, apes and 
        antelopes. It was also possible that they observed some forms of 
        ancestor worship. The Carthaginians introduced the deification of 
        kings, usually after death, as we had in the case of Masinissa, 
        among several others. The priests were originally the family heads 
        before the Carthaginians introduced priesthood leading to the 
        establishment of a class of priests.

        The Phoenicians had their pantheon, like the Greeks/Romans, 
        that they brought with them to North Africa. The supreme god was 
        Baal Hammon, a nature god. Others include Tanit, forerunner of 
        Baal Hammon, and Eshmoun, god of healing. Kings and princes 
        were very eager to imitate the Carthaginian religion. During the

        The Greek gods were already in Africa even before the 
        Romans really had serious contact with Africans during the 3rd 
        Century BC. These gods must have been introduced through the 
        Phoenicians who had been trading with the Greeks. All the Greek 
        deities were known at Carthage as early as the 5th Century BC: 
        Hera, Zeus, Aphrodite, Dionysus, Athena and Demeter. The 
        goddess Demeter, which became Cereres in North Africa, on 
        account of the Eleusinian mysteries, was especially a very 
        influential goddess. A Pythagorean school was in existence at 
        Carthage during the 3rd Century BC. Once Carthage was fully 
        occupied, the Romans came with their gods and deities, alongside 
        the Roman military and administration, especially the Capitoline 
        gods: Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Other Roman gods worshipped in 
        Africa are Saturn, Liber Pater (Bacchus), Mercury, Hercules and 
        Ceres (as Cereres). Later, the worship of the emperors, the 
        Imperial cult, was introduced, similar to Africans’ ancestor 
        worship, though while Africans worshipped their kings after death, 
        the emperors were worshipped alive, to garner loyalty for Rome 
        and her emperors. Thus, there were, everywhere in Africa, Berber, 
        Phoenician, Greek, and Roman gods. Stoicism, Orphism and 
        Pythagoreanism, all combined with the Roman religion to 
        influence the indigenous religion.

        Traditional Africans educational system was mainly informal,

        or the family head was the teacher of the male child. Teaching 
        would be done in the farms. The mother, in the same vein, would 
        teach the female child at home. Daughters were taught weaving, 
        pottery, and how to raise children and assists the men in the farms.

        traditions and conventions. When the Phoenicians came, however, 
        they introduced sophisticated political, technical and general

        Romans’ arrival on the scene. The princes and the nobles also

        hand until the 2nd Century BC when the Latin traders became more

        Latin names. By the 2nd and 3rd Centuries AD only Latin and

        Latin language, among the general public, as the language of the 
        church. Knowledge of Latin would enable the people to understand 
        the sermons of the priests and read the bible. Therefore, the church 
        started teaching Latin. In this way, Latin became widespread as the

        The origin of African Christianity has links to the Church of 
        Ethiopia. Ethiopia had contacts with the Jews way before Jesus 
        Christ was born. One of the contacts is found in the encounter 
        between King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (1 Kings 10). 
        Another is when Jesus was born also, he sought asylum with his 
        parents in Egypt to escape the plot of King Herod to kill him as a 
        baby (Matthew 2: 13-14). The Coptic Church in Egypt values this 
        event and argues that the Good News came first to them through 
        the preaching of the apostle Mark who is believed to have been 
        martyred in Alexandria. Some historians hold that Mark was in 
        Cyrene where he converted many Jews and Greeks before he went 
        to Alexandria in Egypt-though there are no sufficient evidences to 
        prove this. Fatokun says Christianity penetrated into Africa from 
        Asia shortly after the founding of the Christian Church at 
        Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost—6th day of Sivan, A.D. 30.`

        According to Dyron Daughrity, Africans were present on the 
        birthday of Christianity—the day of Pentecost as recorded in Acts 
        2, because mention was made of people from Egypt and Libya. 
        Moreover, the case of the Ethiopian eunuch (an African) who 
        met the evangelist Philip on his way back to Ethiopia from a 
        worship time in Jerusalem is often considered in talking about the 
        history of Christianity in Africa. This eunuch who was a high 
        ranking official in charge of the Ethiopian Queen’s finance, 
        believed the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached to him by Philip and 
        was baptised by him (Luke 8:27-39).
        It is worth pointing out that sub-Saharan Africa came into 
        contact with Christianity through the missionary efforts of Europe 
        in the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, during this 
        missionary time, Daughrity indicates that “for every missionary 
        there were dozens of African leaders.” Today, out of the 59 
        countries in continental Africa, 31 countries have Christianity as 
        the dominant religion.
        In sum, the references to Egypt and the Cyrene in the New 
        Testament; the absence of accepted archaeological and textual 
        evidence prior to the later second century; the complex identity of 
        Jewish Christianity in the first and second centuries; the place of 
        literacy in the formation of Christian identity in Egypt; the nature 
        of “orthodoxy” and “heresy” in the early churches of Egypt; and 
        the relative importance of the Gnostic traditions in explaining the 
        diversity of voices in early Egyptian Christianity were responsible 
        for current debates regarding the origins of Christianity in Egypt.`

        The New Testament mentions several events in which Africans 
        were witnesses to the life of Christ and the ministry of the apostles. 
        It is possible that the history of Christianity in Africa began when 
        these Africans shared what they witnessed with other Africans.
        In the Markan narrative of Jesus’ Passion, Simon of Cyrene 
        (Cyrene is a region in Northern Africa—Libya) helped Christ to 
        carry His cross on the way to Golgotha (Mark 15:21). Daughrity 
        also indicates that after the persecution of the Church in Jerusalem, 
        Africans (some citizens from Cyprus and Cyrene) were those that 
        first preached the Gospel to non-Jews before anyone because the 
        account of Acts 11:19-20 talks about believers coming from 
        Cyrene witnessing to Greeks in Antioch. He further posits that 
        apostle Paul could have been ordained by persons including 
        Africans in the Church in Antioch as Acts 13 records it. For 
        Daughrity, Africa’s extra-canonical pedigree is equally impressive. 
        St. Anthony the Great, the father of monasticism, was an Egyptian; 
        several African Church Fathers defined the Christian faith for us as 
        we understand it today: Athanasius, Clement of Alexandria, 
        Origen, Cyprian and Tertullian. Indeed, Athanasius was the 
        leading theologian in the Trinitarian controversies as well as in the 
        determination of the biblical canon. Athanasius’ home city, 
        Alexandria, was well known as “the leading academic centre of the 
        ancient world.” Alexandria and Carthage (Tunisia) were pivotal in 
        shaping the earliest medieval Western universities, the most 
        important theologian in Christian history, Augustine (354-430), 
        was an African Berber from Algeria. `

        As from the Day of Pentecost, the disciples of Jesus spread out 
        across the known world to take the Word of God and the story of 
        Jesus Christ to the people. Mark arrived in Egypt around 42 C.E., 
        Philip travelled all the way to Carthage before heading East into 
        Asia Minor, Matthew visited Ethiopia (by way of Persia), as did 
        Bartholomew.
        Christianity appealed to disaffected Egyptian population 
        through its representations of resurrection, an afterlife, virgin birth 
        and the possibility that Jesus (God) could be killed and brought 
        back, all of which resonated with more ancient Egyptian religious 
        practices. In Africa Proconsularis and its neighbours, there was a 
        resonance to traditional gods through the concept of Supreme 
        Being. Even the idea of the Holy Trinity could be related to 
        various godly triads, which were taken to be three aspects of a

        After the siege of Jerusalem in 70 C.E., the Egyptian city of 
        Alexandria became a significant centre of Christianity. A bishopric 
        of Alexandria around 49 C.E. was established by the disciple and 
        Gospel writer Mark, and he is honoured today as the person who 
        brought Christianity to Africa. Alexandria was also home to the 
        Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Old Testament, which 
        traditional has it, was created on the orders of Ptolemy II for the 
        use of the large population of Alexandrian Jews. Origen, head of 
        the School of Alexandria in the early third century, is also noted 
        for compiling a comparison of six translations of the Old 
        Testament, namely the Hexapla. 
        The Catechetical School of Alexandria was founded in the late 
        second century by Clement of Alexandria as a centre for the study 
        of the allegorical interpretation of the Bible. It had a mostly 
        friendly rivalry with the School of Antioch, which was based 
        around a literal interpretation of the Bible.
        Christianity was well established in Alexandria but later 
        suffered severe persecutions from A.D. 64. In response, the Church 
        established the Catechetical Schools of Alexandria, among other 
        similar schools of Christian instruction. Many significant leaders 
        of faith emerged from the early African Church. Alexandria had 
        such renowned apologists as Clement, Origen, Athanasius, 
        Anthony and Pachomius. The latter two introduced monasticism, 
        which had its home in the deserts of Egypt before it spread to 
        Western Europe.`

        Persecutions in Egypt resulted in the dispersion of Christians to 
        the innermost regions of Egypt. Egyptian churches spread the 
        Gospel in the Coptic (Egyptian) language and planted churches 
        throughout the interior of Egypt. However, Christianity, in the 
        region, was weakened by theological and doctrinal controversies.
        At the start of the seventh century, the Coptic Church had 
        established itself as the national church and had penetrated every 
        region of the country. However, an influx of Muslims into the 
        continent of Africa, during the Middle Ages, resulted in an 
        exponential increase in Islamic converts, which forced many 
        African Christians to flee to Europe. Missionary efforts by the 
        Roman Catholic and the European Protestant church reclaimed 
        some of the African continent for Christ.

        The Roman Africa or North African Christianity
        The North Africa, which was a Roman colony and called Roman 
        Africa owing to its Roman influences, was the second claimed 
        centre of Christianity in Africa. North Africa was made up of 
        Tunisia, Libya, Algeria and Morocco nations with its capital at 
        Carthage known as Tunisia.`

        North Africans were among the first to receive and embrace 
        the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The early church in North Africa went 
        through severe persecutions A.D. 64 through 311. North Africa, 
        over the first few centuries C.E., became a region for Christian 
        innovation, looking at the nature of Christ, interpreting the Gospels 
        and sneaking in elements from so-called pagan religions. Roman 
        authority had severely subdued people in North Africa; the advent 
        of Christianity quickly became a religion of protest. This is 
        because Christianity was a reason for people to ignore the 
        requirement to honour the Roman Emperor through sacrificial 
        ceremonies as well as a direct statement against Roman rule. By 
        the end of second century, Carthage had produced a pope, namely 
        Victor I who sat on the Chair of Peter in Rome (A.D. 181-191) 
        during the reign of the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus who 
        came from Leptis Magna in Libya. Carthage was equally the 
        headquarters of the Church in North Africa with Agrippius as its 
        first Bishop. Agrippius convened his first African Council (A.D. 
        218-222) and the churches in Tripolitania were represented. North 
        Africa produced such theological giants as Augustine of Hippo, 
        Tertullian and Cyprian.
        Although Christianity began in North Africa several centuries 
        before its introduction in Egypt, the Church in North Africa did not 
        grow as quickly because the North African church used the Latin 
        language in its services and literature, rather than the language of 
        the people.`

        Olarewaju avers that Roman Catholics and Protestants from the 
        West were the main Christians that propagated Christianity in 
        North Africa in the 19th century. At that time there were a large 
        number of Roman Catholic migrants from France and Italy that 
        resuscitated Christianity which had almost disappeared in North 
        Africa owing to the Islamic conquest. The evangelical methods 
        employed by Roman Catholic and Protestant missions to 
        evangelise the people were establishment of schools, hospitals and 
        orphanage centres for both Christians and non-Christians, and 
        translation of the Bible into local languages. These strategies 
        enabled them to have contact with non-Christians and spread 
        Christian moral idealism by precept and example, thereby 
        converting people to Christianity. Africa’s colonial period lasted 
        from the late 1800s until the advent of African Independence 
        Movements in 1951, when Libya became the first former colony to 
        become independent, though Liberia was the first post-colonial

        Ethiopia also known as Abyssinia was the third early centre of 
        Christianity in Africa. Brendan Pringle states that historians have 
        widely accepted the argument that Armenia was the first Christian 
        nation. This important claim has become a source of national pride 
        for the Armenians and has remained virtually undisputed from 
        centuries to date. 
        Fremnatos also known as Frumentius in Europe was kidnapped 
        on his way from India to Aksum. He is described as a trader, 
        philosopher, and theologian and later became a saint. He made a 
        good impression and ended up being tutor to the future king Ezana 
        of the kingdom in the Northern corner of the Ethiopian highlands. 
        He introduced Christianity to Aksum (the Ethiopian branch of 
        Christianity first emerged in the kingdom of Aksum) and the king 
        adopted Christianity as the official religion in 333 A.D. Ezeana’s 
        decision to adopt Christianity was most likely influenced by his 
        desire to solidify his trading relationship with the Roman Empire. 
        Christianity afforded the possibility of unifying the many diverse 
        ethnic and linguistic people of the Aksumite kingdom, a goal of 
        Ezana’s leadership. Aksum was one of the earliest states to 
        develop a coin system in order to service its sophisticated and 
        prosperous economy. Emperor Ezana was the first world leader to 
        put the cross on coins that are the earliest examples of Christian 
        material culture from Ethiopia. Magnificent church buildings were 
        located at Aksum, Matara and Adulis. The construction of the 
        churches served the religious needs of the new administrative and 
        military officials settling in expanded territories. The growth of the 
        Aksumite state ended after the Persian conquest of South Arabia, 
        which displaced the trade routes of the Red Sea. Fremnatos later 
        was consecrated as bishop of Aksum at a ceremony in Alexandria. 
        At the collapse of Aksum dynasty the Ethiopian centre of power 
        moved south and east, taking the Christian tradition with it. 
        Christianity outwardly permeated nearly every Ethiopic 
        manuscript, whether it be biblical, liturgical, theological, 
        philosophical, historical, or even magical scroll, beginning with 
        “In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, 
        one God,” or some similar words. Much of the literature of the 
        Ethiopic Church, much even of its Bible, is as yet unpublished, and 
        exists only in manuscripts either in Abyssinia, or in the great 
        libraries in London, Oxford, Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin and 
        elsewhere. The Ethiopic Church and nation was like a Christian 
        oasis in the surrounding desert of Mahometanism. Their only 
        connexion for centuries with the Christian world was the 
        ecclesiastical connexion with the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria. `

        Nubia also known as Sudan was the fourth centre of Christianity in 
        Africa. The beginnings of Christianity in Nubia are not very clear 
        and well-established. Most experts in the field now think that the 
        conventional dates for the Christianisation are too precise and 
        Christianity may have been known in ancient Nubia long before it 
        was officially adopted. There is now some evidence of an earlier 
        small-scale presence of Christianity in ancient Nubia. The official 
        date for the beginnings of the Christianisation of Nubia is, 
        according to John of Ephesus (516-586), the year A.D. 543 but the 
        influence of Christianity in Egypt must have been felt much 
        earlier, and the Christian religion could have gradually infiltrated 
        into Nubia before its official conversion and made converts among 
        the poor. Though there is as yet relatively little evidence to testify 
        to it, the territory to the South of the Roman Empire could have 
        been Christianised in an informal way by the fourth century and 
        probably much earlier. Traders passing with their caravans from 
        Egypt to the south and persecuted Egyptian Christians fleeing to 
        Nubia may have brought their Christian faith with them. Recent 
        archaeological excavations have uncovered some traces of an 
        earlier presence of Christianity. Polish archaeologists who during 
        their excavations uncovered the cathedrals of Faras, Abdullah 
        Nirqi and Sonqi, claim to have found evidence for Christians 
        residing at Faras as early as AD 400. Archaeological excavations
        also revealed objects with Christian emblems, pottery decorated 
        with the sign of the cross and Christian oil lamps in graves of the 
        fourth and fifth centuries showing Christian presence in Nubia. 
        The Polish excavations at Faras led by K. Michalowski had 
        between 1961-1964 uncovered under the Nobadian Sovereign’s 
        Palace, remains of a Christian church built of unbaked bricks that, 
        according to the Polish archaeologists, “must have antedated the 
        end of the fifth century”. The existence of monasteries and 
        hermitages since the fifth century is another argument in favour of 
        an earlier penetration of the Christian faith into Nubia. 
        It seems that the three Christian Kingdoms on the Nile adopted, 
        at least for a time, two different forms of Christianity. There are 
        accounts of two different Christian missions, a Melkite mission 
        supported by the Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian (483-565), 
        who was a Melkite, or duophysite, and a rival Monophysite 
        mission sent under the patronage of his wife Theodora (500-547), 
        who was an Egyptian-born monophysite. In 543 the King of 
        Nobatia with his royal court was converted to Christianity by a 
        Christian Monophysite mission led by the presbyter Julian sent in 
        542 by the Empress Theodora. Makuria was converted by 
        Chalcedonian emissaries in about 569 AD to the Melkite or 
        Orthodox faith by a mission sent by the Emperor Justinian, though 
        it later, between 660-700, switched to monophysitism. Also, the 
        southernmost kingdom of Alwa or Alodia, which had been 
        prepared for Christianity and partly converted by an infiltration of 
        this faith from the neighbouring kingdom of Aksum, was 
        evangelised in 580 A.D. by Longinus, the Bishop of Philae, and 
        accepted Coptic Monophysite doctrine. This story was recorded by 
        John of Ephesus (516-586), himself a Unionite. Both the written 
        sources and the archaeological evidence showing a change from 
        pagan to Christian burial customs, testify to the fact that in the 
        latter half of the 6th century Christianity was rapidly adopted not 
        only by the rulers but also by a number of the local people. 
        The Nubian Church was closely associated with the state; it 
        was a royal religion, the religion of elite, taking on aspects of a 
        court religion, greatly dependent on the king and the royal 
        patronage. The Christian Church in Nubia was a state institution 
        and economic prosperity of the kingdom allowed for the building 
        of impressive cathedrals and ecclesiastical monuments decorated 
        with splendid frescoes and wall-paintings. Characteristic of Nubian 
        Christianity was the persistence of older, pre-Christian beliefs. 
        Little is known about the nature of liturgy in Nubia. Both 
        Greek and Sahidic Coptic and the Coptic Bible were used in the 
        Nubian Church. Greek which was at that time a lingua franca of 
        the Christian world remained probably the most important 
        language of the Nubian Church, but the Coptic language was also 
        extensively used in Church writings, for official inscriptions and 
        on tombstones written in the Coptic alphabet, an adaptation of the 
        Greek alphabet. It is, however, possible that it was perhaps mostly 
        used by numerous Coptic communities living inside Nubia. 
        Even though Christianity developed in Nubia in great isolation 
        from the rest of Christendom, it flourished, played an important 
        role in the region and was viewed by some scholars “as a centre for 
        the diffusion of Christianity as far as West Africa”.

        Christianity in the South of Sahara Africa comprised West Africa

        Prince Henry of Portugal (1394-1460) championed the war 
        between Christians and Muslims in Europe to Africa. It was 
        through his efforts that the coasts of Africa were visited and the 
        Cape of Good Hope was discovered. It was after his death that the 
        Coast of Sierra Leone and Cabo Mesurado now Modern Monrovia 
        were discovered. Thereafter, Fernando Gomez discovered the 
        Island of Sao Tome, Fernando Po, the Island of the Gulf of Guinea 
        and Senegal along with the coastline of the kingdom of Congo. In 
        1846, Bartholomew Diaz commanded the expedition that reached 
        the cape of South Africa, which he called Tormentoso Cape of 
        Storm, but King John II of Portugal named it Cabo de Bona 
        Esperanca or the Cape of Good Hope. Consequently, the church 
        was established in the 15th century in West Africa and the earliest 
        missionary activity started in the Island off the Coast of the 
        Atlantic. In 1462, Pope II appointed a Portuguese Franciscan as 
        Prefect for Guinea. In 1472, four of the larger Islands have been 
        converted. In the 19th century, European powers such as France, 
        Germany and Britain sent numbers of missionaries, explorers, 
        traders and philanthropists to West Africa. European missionaries 
        were basically individuals sent to West Africa to accomplish the 
        claimed “Three Cs” aims that entailed spreading Civilisation, 
        Christianity and Commerce. During the 19th century, among the 
        Christian societies that sent their missionaries to Africa included 
        the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary (WMMS), the British-based 
        Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS), the London 
        Missionary Society (LMS), the Protestant Missions (PM) from 
        France, Germany and Holland from the United States of America. 
        The French Catholic Mission (FCM) came after the Protestant 
        Mission (PM). Missionaries like J.T. Van der Kemp, John Philip, 
        Thomas Birch Freeman, and Mary Slessor (a Scottish Presbyterian 
        missionary in Nigeria) did not only spread Christianity but also 
        advocated the abolition of slave trade in West Africa. The societies 
        of these missionaries had a duty of abolishing slave trade and 
        promoted legitimate trade between the Africans and Europeans. 
        These missionaries built Fourah Bay in early1827 in Sierra Leone 
        and introduced Elementary School in the Gold Coast and Nigeria 
        by1870s. In 1876, they opened their first secondary school known 
        as the Wesleyan High School which is called Mfantsipim School in

        In A.D. 1488, Bartholomeu Dias (Diaz), a Portuguese navigator 
        was the person who erected a limestone pillar and Christian cross 
        at the Cape of Good Hope. For more than a century Christian 
        missionaries did not arrive in any significant number in the Cape 
        until 1652 when the Dutch East India Company authorised Jan van 
        Riebeeck to establish a resupply station at the Cape. As at that time 
        he had survived a shipwreck off the coast of the Cape in 1648 and 
        later became the governor of the Cape Colony. As from 1658, he 
        encouraged Khoikhoi slaves in the Cape Town to attend mission 
        services. In 1618, the Calvinist Synod ruled that any slave who 
        was baptised should be freed. For this reason, farmers who 
        depended on their slaves refused repeated entreaties from the 
        church authorities in Europe to free these slaves in the Cape. 
        Hence, the slave-owners banned religious instruction for slaves so 
        that none could be baptised. In July1737, Georg Schmidt arrived in 
        South Africa and founded the first Protestant mission called the 
        Moravian Brethren. Uproar occurred in 1742, after the baptism of 
        five Khoikhoi slaves owing to the fact that Christians must be free, 
        not slaves. As a result of this hostility, Schmidt was forced to leave 
        South Africa. This brought an end to all Christian missionary 
        activities for about fifty years. In 1792, the Moravian Brethren 
        returned to South Africa with three missionaries. In 1799, the 
        London Missionary Society sent large numbers of missionaries to 
        the Cape Colony. Thereafter, the Glasgow Missionary Society and 
        the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society arrived, along with 
        missionaries from the United States, France, Germany and 
        Scandinavia. Priorities of most missions were literacy, biblical 
        instruction, translation of the Bible into local languages and hymns 
        books for community singing, and the spiritual benefits of 
        productive labour. Pentecostal Christian movements and 
        Charismatic Christian churches emerged between the middle of 
        19th and 20th centuries in South Africa.`

        Urbanisation, traditional religion, resentment of the population of 
        Roman administration and the division of the continent aided the 
        spread of Christianity in Africa. Urbanisation was a key factor in 
        the development of North African Christianity. Roman life in 
        North Africa was heavily concentrated around urban centres—by 
        the end of the second century, there was upwards of six million 
        people living in Roman North African provinces (Egypt, Libya, 
        Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco). Alexandria, considered the second 
        city after Rome, had 150,000 inhabitants by the third century. 
        There were echoes of traditional religions found in Christianity, 
        which proved key in the spread of African Christianity. Outside the 
        cities, life was less influenced by Roman culture. Traditional gods 
        were still worshipped, such as the Phoenician Ba’al Hammon
        (equivalent to Saturn) and Ba’al Tanit (a goddess of fertility) in 
        Africa Proconsuaris and Ancient Egyptian beliefs of Isis, Osiris
        and Horus. The resentment of the population of Roman 
        administration, especially the imposition of taxes and the demand 
        that the Roman Emperor must be worshipped akin to a god was the 
        third key factor in the spread of Christianity through North Africa. 
        The division of the continent made it easier for the missionaries 
        who came to Liberia and West Africa to take control in West 
        Africa.

        The humid and unhealthy climate (Latitudes 23½ON-Tropic of

        insects (mosquitoes and the tsetse flies), lack of good natural

        challenges to missionary enterprises in Africa.
        The contributions of the Early African Church
        The expansion of the missionary movement into Africa was part of 
        the growing conception of Christian responsibility for the 
        regeneration of African peoples. The anti-slavery issue and the 
        humanitarian conscience also played a vital role in stimulating 
        European interest in Africa and gave an impetus to mission work.
        Christian missionaries of all denominations spent many years 
        exploring local African languages and translating portions of the 
        Bible, Prayers and Hymns into African languages. The publication 
        of the Bible in full or in part, and Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress 
        from this World to that which is to Come in British Africa, were 
        usually the first major publications in most African languages and 
        in many cases the Bible remained for a long time the only 
        publication that people could read in their mother tongue. Vast 
        literacy campaigns were based on the translated portion of the 
        Bible.

        Christian missionaries established schools because education 
        was deemed indispensable to their aim, but always placed religion 
        at the forefront of the school curriculum. Cultural contacts with the 
        West led by the Christian missionaries transformed African

        societies. Missionaries, who were themselves products of the 
        Western Christian civilisation, carried with them their cultural 
        values and had little doubt about the superiority of their culture. 
        They took from it its conventional features, building churches and 
        schools in the European style and imposing the habits and ethos of 
        the Western Christian civilisation on their converts. For example, 
        the forms of religious service missionaries used, though translated 
        into African languages, were reproductions of the liturgy of their
        home church, replete with hymns. The adoption of Christianity 
        also meant acculturation into the world of Western civilisation, 
        ideas and technology, with Christianity went also westernisation.
        The missionaries taught everyone in West Africa the same 
        language, so communication in West Africa increased as the 
        language barriers decreased. Likewise as communication 
        increased, unity also increased among the natives of West Africa. 
        As a result of the missionaries’ work and goals, ethnic separation 
        began to decrease as well. The majority of the unity which 
        Christian missionaries helped to achieve was non-political. 
        However, the work of the Christian missionaries in West Africa 
        also brought division among the families and the peoples between 
        those natives who would, and the people who would not accept 
        Christianity. The natives of West Africa experienced a loss of 
        cultural identity due to the westernisation the missionaries brought 
        along with Christianity. Reid says in Missionaries and West 
        African Nationalism missionaries symbolised “Christian values, 
        Western schools, hospitals and churches”. The twofold effect the 
        Christian missionaries had on the unity of the tribes in West Africa 
        and Liberia contributed to the difficult task of coexistence on the 
        continent of Africa.

        One may advance several reasons for this neglect. Oriental

        embracing primarily the Arab element and including as a corollary 
        the Turkish and Persian elements. In the larger context, African 
        Muslim history suffers from the same neglect that characterises 
        Africa in general. One may legitimately infer that European denial 
        of African history is in part a deliberate attempt to deny the 
        African his historical past, which was not less brilliant than that of 
        medieval Europe. How else could one justify the Trans-Atlantic 
        slave trade that lasted more than three hundred years and resulted 
        in the forced shipment of a hundred million men, women and 
        children? To enslave a continent one has to first dehumanise it. 
        Until recent times, Africa was referred to as “the dark continent”, 
        bereft of historical or civilisational achievements. Muslim 
        scholarship, aping the West during the colonial era, went along 
        with this denial. Only now is the historical contribution of African

        Africa is a vast continent, second only to Asia in size and five 
        times the size of Europe. It is home to the most desolate deserts 
        and it has some of the thickest forests. The great expanse of the 
        Sahara separates the Mediterranean world from the rest of Africa. 
        The Nile snakes through the eastern desert, giving life to a narrow 
        patch of green, sustaining more than a hundred million people in 
        Egypt and the Sudan. West of Egypt lies the great Libyan Desert, 
        uninhabitable except for a narrow strip close to the Mediterranean. 
        The Atlas Mountains cover the northwestern territories embracing 
        Algeria and Morocco and protrude into Spain. South of 
        Mediterranean Africa, extending in a broad swath is the Sahara, the 
        largest and the harshest desert on planet earth. It occupies an area 
        of more than three million square miles, almost the size of the 
        United States. Only a few well-defined trade routes traverse this 
        vast terrain, providing civilisational links between the

        Sahara from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. East of the Ethiopian 
        highlands, the terrain once again changes to the Somali pastures 
        and desert. As one traverses southward towards the equator, the 
        grasslands change to dense forest. These forests are a few hundred 
        miles deep in western Africa but grow to a dense patch of 
        impassable territory in the Congo basin extending through Zaire,

        The history of Africa is strongly influenced by its geography 
        and its topography. Egypt, situated at the confluence of Asia and 
        Africa, is a child of the Nile. From the time of the Pharaohs, the 
        Nile valley has provided political, cultural and social unity to the 
        area. The fellaheen of the Nile constitute the oldest continuous 
        cultural unit in the world. Egypt also acted as the conduit for 
        African art, science and culture to the rest of the world. 
        Specifically, the development of Greek thought in the eastern 
        Mediterranean in the 5th century BC owes a great deal to the 
        wisdom of Africa. Egypt belongs to the Mediterranean world and 
        is the doorway to North Africa. It sits astride an axis linking the 
        Mediterranean civilisations with the civilisations of the Indian 
        Ocean. It provides a bridgehead to Asia and its historical influence 
        extends into the Syrian highlands. In turn, Egypt has attracted the 
        attention of Asian conquerors, as happened in the Persian invasion

        Arab-Islamic invasion of the 7th century and the attempted

        In the Maghrib, the Atlas Mountains are inhabited by the

        rule through the centuries. Land and sea trade routes interconnect 
        the Mediterranean lands. Ancient empires welded them into a 
        common dominion. The Maghrib, as well as Egypt, was part of the 
        Roman Empire. In the 7th century, as Umayyad armies raced across 
        Asia, Africa and Europe, all of these territories came under the 
        sway of the Islamic Empire. Initially, each of these empires 
        established their presence in fortified towns along the coast, 
        whereas the people of the interior largely remained untouched. 
        Consequently, a certain tension between the settled city population 
        and the pastoral nomadic population of the hinterland has always 
        existed in the Maghrib. In the classical Islamic era (700-1250), the 
        Maghrib held the key to Spain and southwestern Europe. When the 
        Berbers were supportive, Muslim armies advanced into Spain and 
        France. When there were disturbances in the Atlas Mountains, the 
        advance stopped or there was a retreat. In the 11th and 12th
        centuries, it was the turbulence in the Maghrib that largely 
        determined the fate of Muslim Spain.

        These trade routes were the conduits not only for a two-way 
        exchange of men and material, but also ideas. One such sublime 
        idea was the idea of Islam. Africa was in the cradle of Islam. 
        Among the most honored companions of Prophet Muhammed 
        (S.A.W) was Bilal ibn Rabah, the first muadhin of Islam. The 
        proximity of Hijaz to Abyssinia ensured continuous contacts 
        between Africans and the Arabs of Makkah. When enmity of the 
        pagan Arabs to the mission of Islam was at its height, the Prophet 
        ordered some of his companions to migrate to Abyssinia. Several 
        waves of believers did migrate (circa 620) and were received with 
        honor by the Negus, King of Abyssinia. These émigrés returned to 
        Mecca when peace was established between the Muslims and the 
        pagans, but contacts continued and the highlands of Ethiopia were 
        the first in Africa to hear the call of Islam.
        According to oral traditions in western Africa, some of the 
        descendants of Bilal ibn Rabah migrated to Mallel, the Arabic 
        name for Mali. Specifically, the Mandinka clan Keita, which is 
        generally credited with founding the great Mali Empire, claims its 
        descent from Bilal ibn Rabah, referred to as Bilali Bunamah in the 
        Mandinka language. Tradition also has it that some of the 
        companions of the Prophet migrated to Libya and from there to the 
        Lake Chad area further south. Such migrations would be in 
        keeping with the exhortation of the Prophet to his Companions to 
        go forth and spread the message of Islam in the far reaches of the 
        world. Much of the history of early Africa is oral and there is no 
        reason to doubt that African migrants from Mecca established 
        contact with and settled down in the developed regions of West 
        Africa.

        The Muslims took Egypt and Libya from the Byzantine Empire

        civilisation in Egypt, imparted to it a transcendence based on 
        Tawhid, so that the land of the Nile became a cradle of the nascent 
        Islamic civilisation. Within forty years of the conquest of Egypt, 
        Umayyad armies had reached the Atlantic Ocean. Uqba bin Nafi, 
        the conqueror of the Maghrib, founded the city of Kairouan (circa 
        670), in modern Tunisia. According to some accounts, Uqba bin 
        Nafi led an expedition towards Mauritania. The Kunta tribe of 
        Sene-Gambia, claim their descent from Uqba bin Nafi. The Kuntas

        had a profound impact on the introduction of Islam into West 
        Africa. Sidi Muhammed’s son Sidi al Bakkai introduced the 
        Qadariya order into West Africa in the 15th century. The Qadariya 
        order, named after Shaikh Abdul Qader Jeelani (1077-1166) of 
        Baghdad, was a major force in the spread of Islam in Africa, India,

        merchandise. Ghana controlled the gold mines to the south and as 
        trade increased, it required an increasing supply of gold. The 
        Omayyads, as well as successor kingdoms in the Maghrib, saw to 
        it that trade routes were protected. They established trade centers 
        along the caravan routes to enhance the flow of goods and ensure 
        the safety of merchants. The primary export of West Africa was 
        gold. Other products included salt, ivory and kola nuts. In return, 
        the North Africans provided religious and administrative services 
        and brought in horses from North Africa, spices from Asia and 
        books of learning from Kairouan, Baghdad and Bukhara. Slave 
        trade was not a principal element in the Arab-African transactions, 
        as is sometimes claimed by European writers. It was much later in 
        the 17th and 18th centuries that Omani merchants competed with 
        the Europeans for slaves in the Bantu areas of East Africa.
        It was trade, more than any expedition or migration of Arabs 
        that firmly established Islam in West Africa. Among the important 
        trading centers were Tahert in Algeria, Sijilmasa in Morocco, 
        Tanderi in Mali and Agadez in Niger. Caravan routes were 
        connected to the rich commercial towns in the Sene-Gambia and 
        Niger basins as well as Lake Chad. The Sanhaja who inhabited the 
        Sahara acted as escorts to the trade caravans and were the first to 
        accept Islam as early as the Omayyad period in the 8th century. In 
        the Sene-Gambia and Niger River basins, local merchants, 
        noblemen and chieftains led the introduction of Islam. Several 
        reasons may be advanced for this. The merchants were obviously 
        impressed with the business ethics as well as the contractual laws 
        in the Shariah. The noblemen and the chieftains could draw upon 
        the administrative and organisational talents of Muslims. But more 
        important, Islam provided a universal creed and a universal 
        community wherein all believers were equal. By the 9th century, 
        important Muslim centers existed in the cities of Gao, Ghana and 
        Tekrur. By the 10th century, the rulers of Gao had accepted Islam. 
        By the 11th century, the kings of the powerful state of Ghana had 
        themselves become Muslim.

        relationship between man and the One Omniscient Divine.
        The presence of a vibrant Islamic community in West Africa 
        acted as a catalyst for social and political movements in the 
        Maghrib and the Sudan. In the first half of the 11th century, the 
        Murabitun rose from the steppes of West Africa to dominate all of 
        the Maghrib and Spain. They established ribats, which were a 
        combination of fortresses, madrasahs and spiritual training centers, 
        in the Mauritania-Morocco region. By 1150, these ribats had 
        coalesced into a centralised political authority and produced a mass 
        movement, which displaced the fading Omayyad dynasty in Spain 
        and the decaying Fatimids of North Africa. As late as the 19th
        century, Islam provided the motivating force for internal reform 
        and resistance to European colonisation in West Africa. The work 
        of Uthman Dan Fuduye (d. 1817) established the Sokoto Caliphate 
        and provided inspiration to slave revolts as far away as Jamaica.

        The introduction of Islam into East Africa followed a 
        somewhat different path from that in West Africa. East Africa 
        includes a broad swath of territory embracing the modern nations

        and Mozambique. Of the 100 million people who live in that 
        region today, approximately 40% are Muslim. Since pre-Islamic 
        times, East Africa was known to the Arabs as the land of the Zanj 
        and was a part of the large and prosperous Indian Ocean trade zone 
        that linked India, China, Persia, Arabia and the eastern shores of 
        Africa. China exported porcelain. From India came fine cotton. 
        The products from the Persian Gulf included silk and 
        manufactured goods while Yemen exported incense and horses. 
        African exports included ivory, gold, animal skins, ambergris and 
        rice. Dotting the coastline of the Indian Ocean were large and 
        small trading centers extending in an arc from the tip of Africa to 
        the Straits of Malacca. Included among these were the East African 
        cities of Mombasa, Pemba, Kilwa and Shofala.

        Islam was introduced into East Africa as early as the 7th
        century by successive waves of refugees from Arabia. The first 
        group arrived in the year 698 fleeing the persecution of the 
        Omayyad governor of Iraq, Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. Shortly thereafter, a 
        second group arrived, led by the Kharijites Sulayman and Saeed, 
        whose revolt against the Caliph Abdul Malik had failed. Sulayman 
        established an Ibadi state at Lamu, just north of Mombasa, in 
        modern Kenya. More migrations followed as the persecution of 
        dissidents in the Omayyad Caliphate increased. In the year 729, 
        after a particularly harsh crack down on the Shi’a community, 
        there was a substantial migration of Shi’as to Mombasa. After the 
        Abbasid revolution of 750, as the Omayyads were hunted down 
        and killed, it was the turn of the Omayyads to flee and seek refuge 
        in Africa. In 908 several thousand Iraqis, fleeing the destructions 
        caused by the Karamatians, arrived in Somalia and built for 
        themselves the new towns of Barawah and Shakah.
        Following the Seljuk invasions of the 11th century, there were 
        substantial social dislocations in Persia. To escape the ravages of 
        war, some Persians moved further west towards Anatolia but some 
        migrated to East Africa. Most of those fleeing the political turmoil 
        in Iraq and Persia were men. In East Africa they intermarried with 
        the local Bantu ladies, creating a rich Arab-Persian-Bantu 
        amalgam and a vibrant Swahili (meaning, coastal) culture. It was 
        from this matrix that the powerful Swahili dynasties of the 13th and 
        14th centuries arose.

        Early in the 12th century, the Swahilis founded a state with its 
        capital at Kilwa. By the turn of the century, this state had expanded 
        to include the entire coastline from Zanzibar to Shofala. To the 
        interior it extended its borders to the Zambezi River including the 
        gold mines in Zimbabwe and Manika. Gold and trade brought 
        prosperity to the land attracting immigrants both from Yemen and 
        the African hinterland. New towns such as Titi and Sunnah grew 
        up to cater to the gold trade.
        In the 13th century, Oman emerged as a strong naval power in 
        the western Indian Ocean. The Omanis captured the southern 
        coastline of the Arabian Peninsula, including Yemen, and extended 
        their influence to the Sahel. In 1303 the Omani Sultan Suleyman 
        shifted his capital from Oman to Batah in Kenya. For the next 500 
        years, the history of the Sahel was inextricably linked with that of 
        Oman and the Persian Gulf.
        Among the refugees from Arabia and Persia were many ulema. 
        The influx of scholars, merchants and refugees planted the seeds of 
        the new Islamic community. The Shariah provided the basis for 
        commercial transactions. The Shafi’i fiqh, practiced in southern 
        Arabia, took hold in East Africa. The community grew as 
        conversion of the Bantus gathered momentum through 
        intermarriage.

        added stability to the newborn communities and facilitated the 
        movement of merchant and scholar alike, furthering the growth of 
        Islam. The melting of Arab, Persian and Bantu elements produced 
        a new language, Swahili, which was written in the Arabic script

        In 1329, the great world traveler Ibn Batuta visited Mogadishu, 
        Mombasa and Kilwa. He found Mogadishu to be a thriving market 
        place “with paved streets and many large domed mosques”. The 
        people were “law abiding and pious, wore plenty of gold and silver 
        jewelry and ate off Chinese porcelain.” Further south, the city of 
        Kilwa was the capital of a large kingdom ruled by Sultan Mawahid 
        Hasan, the fourth in the line of the Mahdali dynasty founded by 
        immigrants from Yemen. Ibn Batuta had an audience with the 
        Sultan and found him to be “a man of great humility who sits with

        The spread of Islam further south towards the horn of Africa

        its 300 mosques and slaughtered its population. In 1508 they 
        occupied Mozambique and more slaughter followed. The 
        Portuguese challenge was taken up by the Ottomans. The Omani 
        Sultan, Saif ibn Sultan, working with the Ottoman navy, drove off 
        the Portuguese, reclaimed most of the Sahel (meaning, the coast) 
        for the Muslims and moved his capital from Oman to Kilwa. The 
        struggle for control of East Africa continued through much of the 
        16th and 17th centuries with the Omani capital shifting between 
        East Africa and the Persian Gulf. Successive Omani dynasties, like 
        the Yarubis and Sayyedis participated in this struggle alongside the 
        Ottomans. After the year 1600, a military equilibrium developed 
        with the Muslims controlling the coastline north of Shofala and the 
        Portuguese holding onto the areas south of it.

        In the 17th century the Dutch displaced the Portuguese as the 
        dominant naval power in the Indian Ocean. Many of the important 
        Portuguese colonies, such as Cape Town in South Africa, Colombo 
        in Sri Lanka and Malacca in Malaysia, fell to the Dutch. It was the 
        Indonesian islands, however, that felt the full brunt of Dutch 
        colonial designs. In their frequent wars with the sultans of the 
        Archipelago, the Dutch captured Muslim prisoners and shipped 
        them to Cape Town. Some among the prisoners were scholars and 
        Sufi shaykhs. These scholars were the first to introduce Islam into 
        the area around the Cape of Good Hope. Today, the tombs of many 
        of these honored shaykhs dot the landscape of southern Africa. The 
        venerated tomb of Syed Abdur Rahman who was brought in chains 
        from Sumatra to Cape Town in 1652 illustrates this observation.
        In 1805, the Omani Sultan, Saeed Ibn Sultan shifted his capital 
        from Muscat to Zanzibar. A ruler with foresight and wisdom, he 
        built Oman into a prosperous empire. He encouraged agriculture 
        and trade, introduced the cultivation of cloves into Zanzibar, 
        facilitated Muslim immigration and invited the neighboring 
        African rulers to embrace Islam. After his death, the Empire of 
        Oman was divided into an Arab province and an East African 
        province. Sultan Majid Ibn Saeed became the Sultan of the Sahel.

        Germany, Portugal and Italy reached an understanding to carve up 
        the East African territories. In 1883, the Germans occupied 
        Zanzibar. The Portuguese moved into the area south of Cape 
        Delgado and annexed it to Mozambique. The British moved into 
        Kenya. In 1887 the Zanzibar Sultan Bargash ibn Saeed sold the 
        cities of Dar al-Salaam, Kilwa and Lindi to the Germans for a sum 
        of four million Marks. In1889 he accepted a British protectorate 
        over Pemba and Zanzibar. The following year he surrendered 
        Mogadishu to the Italians for a sum of 160,000 Indian rupees. In 
        1894 he gave a perpetual lease on Mombasa to the British for an 
        annual payment of 10,000 British pounds. In 1907, the British 
        organised the territories near Lake Nyasa under the name of 
        Nyasaland that later became the Republic of Malawi. The Germans 
        organised their colonial holdings under the name of Tanganyika;

        The colonialists suppressed the study of Arabic and discouraged

        Muslim societies were in a state of retrenchment, and the quality 
        and comprehensiveness of madrasah based education suffered.

        This chapter attempts to look at the relationship between culture 
        and environment, and examine how the latter has influenced the 
        culture of various peoples in Nigeria. We shall first clarify the two 
        key words underlying this discourse – Environment and Culture.
        Environment: Environment is the surroundings or circumstances 
        in which a person or animal lives. It is about the factors 
        constituting the surroundings of an organism and influencing its 
        behaviour, reproduction and survival. In fact, it is about human 
        interactions with the natural world. The earth’s environment is, 
        therefore, composed of biotic factors (living components) and 
        abiotic factors (non-living components), which together form a 
        dynamic, biological, chemical and physical system. Therefore, 
        three components in the earth’s structure give rise to its ability to 
        support plant, animal and human life—its solid surface, the waters 
        which cover 71% of that surface, and its gaseous atmosphere, 
        detectable perhaps as high as 500P mi (8,000km) above the 
        surface. 
        The Bible and Quran suggest that the earth’s environment is 
        the lower firmament including everything that occupies it; human, 
        animals, plant, materials and services rendered within it as well as 
        its state of condition at any given time. It is apt to add here that this 
        also includes those phenomena that are hidden from the 
        comprehension of human beings.`

         Culture has been defined as the total way of life of a 
        given society or people. Put differently, it is the way of life of man 
        over the ages, within a time frame. But the classic definition of 
        culture was provided by the 19th century English anthropologist, 
        Edward Burnett Tylor in 1871. In his book, “Primitive Culture”, he 
        defines culture as “that complex whole which includes knowledge, 
        belief, art, morals, law, customs and any other capabilities and 
        habits acquired by man as a member of society” (Scott and 
        Marshall 2005:133). From Tylor’s definition, we can infer that 
        there is a relationship between culture and environment which he 
        referred to as society. The definition equally shows that man is the 
        contact between culture and environment.`

        Tools and language made them efficient hunters but not really 
        different in their impact on the life of the time from other kinds of 
        social animals. It is important, then, to note that each society 
        supports a unique or particular cultural civilisation as a result of 
        the behaviour and way of life of its peoples. Such cultural traits 
        and characteristics are at times determined or influenced by the 
        environment. These manifested in the people’s way of life,

        title : "The effects of climate",
        content : `
        The effects of climate on the culture of various peoples of 
        Nigeria have been noteworthy. The climatic factor is significant 
        not only in relation to its effect on the character of the vegetation, 
        but also because climate has, by and large, played a dominant role 
        in the ways of life, including the pattern of economic activities of 
        the various peoples of Nigeria. As a result of differences in 
        climate, the type of work and general attitude to life are also 
        different from one region to another. In Nigeria, we experience 
        different types of weather condition between the north and the 
        south. The northern area is relatively dry while the southern area is 
        relatively wet. The north supports open savannah vegetation while 
        the south supports thick forested vegetation. 
        This situation, to a large extent, determines the agricultural 
        activities and the type of crops being cultivated in these two 
        distinct areas. The people of the north cultivate grains such as 
        millets, guinea corn and acha, while the forest peoples cultivate 
        root crops such as yams, cassava and cocoyam. However, the 
        middle belt region which has a combination of the climate of the 
        north and south has a mixed culture in which the food crops of the 
        south are cultivated side by side with those of the far north. Cash 
        crops produced by these areas include groundnuts and cotton in the 
        north and cocoa, oil palm and rubber in the south. These are 
        mainly for exports.

        The environment might limit the amount of food production in 
        certain areas whereas it could boost the production in other areas. 
        It is possible, therefore, that a particular item known in a particular 
        environment might not be available in other environments. The 
        factors of bad soil and absence of external influence could be 
        accountable for this. The manner of food production differs from 
        one environment to another. In some areas, as a result of low level 
        of technology, we have basically subsistence economy, that is 
        people producing only for consumption. Whereas in some other 
        areas, due to high level of technological advancement, food 
        production is not only meant for subsistence but more importantly 
        for exchange. Moreover, the way and manner we prepare and eat 
        certain foods differ from one another. For example, although the 
        Igbo of the south east and the Yoruba of the south west cultivate 
        yam, the former do not like to consume pounded yam which is a 
        highly favoured delicacy to the latter.
        Topography, like the climate, determines settlement patterns 
        and house structure and type. For example, the people in the 
        riverine areas build their houses on the water and such houses are 
        usually constructed with stilts. In the areas with abundant soil, 
        houses are constructed with clay while in some areas with 
        abundance of long grasses, thatched huts construction is a common 
        feature. Closely related to the above is the fact that environment 
        determines the type of work or economic activities engaged in by 
        the people. Here the influence of environment on the culture of the 
        given society has manifested considerably. Thus, people in the 
        riverine areas are indigenous fishermen and salt makers. For 
        example the Ijaws in Nigeria who are found in the western and 
        eastern Niger delta are well known fishermen because of their 
        riverine environment.
        The Igbo present a typical example of a people whose way of 
        they faced land problem, emanating from leaching and soil 
        impoverishment, the Igbos were forced to migrate to other areas; 
        hence an influx of Igbo in all parts of Nigeria and perhaps the 
        whole world. As a result, for a long time, they developed a culture 
        of trading and adventure to the extent that the average Igbo man is 
        looked up to as a potential trader no matter the educational feat or 
        status attained in life. In the course of their migration and 
        subsequent settlement, the Igbos adopt the good aspects of their 
        host communities’ cultures.

        facilitated cattle rearing and the pastoralist culture of the people. 
        Thus, the Fulani are well-known as cattle rearers. Furthermore, the 
        long dry season made it necessary for the Fulani cattlemen to adopt 
        a nomadic mode of existence.

        In some areas where there are rocks, big 
        stones, mountains and trees, the early people of these areas 
        worshipped these objects. The objects are believed to have spirits 
        residing in them which were to have rendered crucial assistance to 
        the people of the community in time of tribulations. An example 
        here is the Olumo rock in Abeokuta and Oke-badan hill in the city 
        of Ibadan. Likewise in the riverine areas, the tendency to worship 
        the river goddess was very rife. In fact there were shrines made in 
        the form of aquatic animals, especially hippopotamus and 
        crocodile.
        Music and poems composed by people always feature the 
        things in the natural environment like trees, mountains, stones, 
        rivers and other objects which are closely related to and foster 
        links with the past and the ancestors. The music and poems are 
        more often than not in a comparative style. It is interesting to also 
        note that the dancing steps or styles of people to some music are at 
        times indicative of the type of daily activities they engage in. 
        Some dancing styles of the riverine people are suggestive of the 
        canoe paddling activities. From the above, and in line with the 
        theory of environmental determinism, it can be said that the 
        environment partly or largely determines the culture or civilisation 
        of people through the ages.

        However, because of its abstract nature, some people are of the 
        view that culture cannot be influenced by the environment. It is 
        rather believed that the influence of environment on culture is only 
        noticeable in the kind of economic advantage it offers. But 
        recently, a school of thought in anthropology—School of 
        Cultural – Ecology has emerged. This school attempts to take a 
        balanced view between culture and environment through a system 
        known as ‘Eco-System.’ In this system, all parts are 
        interdependent. In the event that a part of the system is faulty, the 
        whole system is affected. Indeed, this applies to some other 
        systems such as mechanical, electronic, etc. In a sense, cultural 
        ecology implies that culture and environment are interdependent 
        and thus influence each other. Thus far, we have established the 
        effect of climate diversity on culture. On the other hand a change 
        in culture of a people has the potential effect of modifying that 
        people’s environment. In other words, it can be established also 
        that culture change has a modifying effect on environment.

        As noted earlier, man in the early period lived a culture or 
        civilisation of wandering, food gathering and hunting. He made no 
        significant impact on his environment. As a matter of fact, he was 
        at the mercy of his environment. Later, with his gradually 
        developed skills, man began to modify his environment. This 
        started when man first leant the use of fire for warmth and to cook 
        his food. About 10,000 years ago, there was a cultural revolution 
        that might have begun in South West Asia. This revolution has 
        been termed ‘Neolithic Revolution’, it brought about practicing 
        change in man’s way of life. Man started practicing agriculture and 
        with time he was transformed from wanderer and food gatherer to 
        a settled man and food producer. He developed the knowledge of 
        cultivation and domestication of plants and animals. There was 
        thus a form of symbiotic association between him and animals. As 
        he gives the animals protection from the wild predators, the 
        animals in return give him meat, egg and milk.
        With the revolution, there was the development of villages and 
        towns consequent on food production revolution. Thus, people live 
        in villages and towns, and this concomitantly led to population 
        increase. There was also the development of specialised crafts like 
        weaving, smithing, carving, etc, and this resulted in large scale 
        trading and commercial activities. There was, therefore, the 
        development of greater economy. Thus, with permanent 
        settlement, supported by surplus goods and services for exchange 
        in the market place political, social and religious activities were 
        beginning to take shape. With time, man started to practice 
        division of labour. Above all, there was greater cultural 
        elaboration. This new development not only had effect on culture 
        but it has more on the environment.

        But, the society was not to remain at that level, as culture, 
        though, abstract, was dynamic. With time, the world witnessed 
        great socio-cultural and economic revolution beyond the level of 
        the Neolithic Revolution especially in Europe. Thus, the 
        Industrial Revolution of the 19th century which began in Western 
        Europe with England as the pace-setter was to change the 
        environment a great deal. This was a dramatic period of economic 
        and technical change in Britain during the late 18th and early 19th
        centuries. During the years 1760 – 1840/1850, the steam engine 
        came into widespread use; it in turn provided power for newly 
        developed machines that did work that was previously performed 
        manually. The innovation was greatest in the cotton textile 
        industry. This steam engine was a decisive factor in the industrial 
        revolution as well as one of the most significant steps ever taken 
        by man in mastering his environment. The process is just that the 
        energy stored up in steam was converted into mechanical work. 
        This is more evident in the transportation, communication, and 
        agricultural sectors. The world witnessed radical economic 
        reorganisation resulting in progressive movement from agricultural
        economy to industrial or technological economy, accompanied 
        with the development of new cultural values, larger societies, 
        greater exchange of goods and services, and further lowering of the 
        death rate.`

        cocoa, oil palm, rubber, groundnut, cotton, etc. Therefore, the need 
        for the source of raw materials and later the sale of finished

        Industry produces its share of pollution of environment from

        appreciable reduction in the amount of rich farmland. The effect 
        can also be seen in the exploration and exploitation of crude oil in 
        Nigeria. The activities associated with oil industry in Nigeria have 
        often turned the Delta region into a difficult terrain with great risk 
        of accidents of all kinds. The region has times without number 
        witnessed pollution by oil slicks as well as explosion of oil wells. 
        Incidents of oil pipeline bursts are rife. These have often resulted 
        in the destruction of vegetation farmlands, and human settlement. 
        Gas flaring also affects the environment, causing discomfort, 
        scorching the flora and fauna. In short, there is a major disrupting 
        influence on the eco-system of the entire region.
        Another more specialised type of pollution occurs in the realm 
        of agricultural activities. This happens as a result of intensive 
        application of herbicides, insecticides, and fertilisers which break 
        down to harmful residues and threaten many species of animal life. 
        The natural concentration in the course of biological food-chains

        environment and with other beings beyond his physical space. 
        Human communication involves speaking, listening, reading,

          title : "Definition of Communication",
          content : `
        The concept or word ‘communication’ straddles diverse fields of 
        study and as such it might be interesting to embark on a journey to 
        find an acceptable definition that fits all. Williams (1989) notes,
        that communication is the art of expressing ideas and the science 
        of transmitting information.
        Agee, Edwin and Phillip (1994) as well as Whetmore (1989) 
        see communication as the act of sending information, ideas and 
        attitude, from one person to another where the connecting thread is 
        the idea that is transferred from one person to another. It refers to 
        what is transferred, the means of transfer and to the whole process 
        itself. Communication as a complex terminology cannot be easily 
        contextualised into particular definitions. Through communication, 
        people share ideas, feelings, thoughts, facts, opinions, values and 
        emotions with each other. Therefore, from routine socialisation, it 
        is apparent that people are involved in various types of 
        communication such that the knowledge and application of 
        134 Amenaghon Francis
        effective communication is acclaimed as very important to every 
        society or organisation. It is observed that this ability breeds 
        success, as every intended message is conveniently packaged.
        Human communication is well developed based on the ability 
        of man to handle symbols in thought and in speech. Williams 
        (1989) notes that we are capable not only of knowing but also of 
        preserving and sharing our knowledge and we can observe and
        comment on our own processes of thought and observation. He 
        adds that no human capability has been more fundamental to the 
        development of civilisation than the ability to collect, share, and 
        use knowledge.

        elements in the communication process that affect the originality 
        (fidelity) of the message sent by the receiver. Noise in the 
        communication process comes in different forms including:
        (a) Psychological Noise – This relates to the mind or mental 
        state of the people in the communication encounter. 
        Conditions such as tiredness, sickness, hunger, anger, 
        sorrow and joy affect the reception of messages from both 
        the sender and receiver.
        (b) Channel Noise – This results from the travel path of a 
        message. It could be mechanical, when the signal of the 
        electronic transmission device is faulty and the signal is 
        weak. In the print media, noise could result from poor 
        quality ink or paper. It could be physiological. When the 
        five senses are not functioning well. There is a higher 
        probability of not being able to make meaning of the 
        content. 
        (c) Linguistic Noise – Linguistic results from improper use of 
        language. This is further divided into the following:
        (i) Semantic Noise – In English language, semantic 
        noise relates to meanings of words. When a writer 
        uses verbosity to communicate to a general 
        audience, that do not have the professional 
        138 Amenaghon Francis
        understanding of the technical jargons that are 
        used, meaning would be minimal to the receivers.
        (ii) Phonological Noise – Phonology relates to speech 
        sound. This occurs when words are wrongly 
        pronounced.
        (iii) Grammatical Noise – The wrong application of the 
        rules of grammar can result in noise. Problems with 
        tenses, subject-verb agreement and punctuation 
        errors can serve as grammatical noise. For instance,

        (iv) Morphological Noise – The study of morphology 
        pertains to morphemes (any of the grammatical or 
        lexical meaningful units forming or underlying a 
        word, that are not divisible themselves into smaller 
        units). E.g. Out, go and ‘ing’ forming “outgoing” 
        Aina (2003:28) explains that morphological noise 
        arises from a wrong or complicated word formation 
        or from inadvertent spelling alteration for effect. 
        Fig. 10.2: Grahpic representation of the communication process.
        (Adapted from: Borzyskowski IIMS 1992 Interactive multimedia model)
        Communication is seen as a linear flow-One way flow-from the 
        source –message –channel and receivers. It is also a multi￾dimensional cyclical, interactional process which has no beginning 
        and no ending. It is seen as a process that does not have a 
        permanent or fixed sender and it is viewed as transaction between 
        the sender and the receiver which keeps changing roles as the 
        communication encounter moves from the sender to the receiver.

        Communication creates for meaningful interaction among people 
        who are engaged at different levels of interaction. Human 
        communication can be grouped as verbal and non-verbal 
        communication. Verbal communication is further divided into oral 
        and written communication.

        include the following
        (a) It lacks permanence;
        (b) It is easily deniable;
        (c) Oral communication does not give room for precision or 
        crystallisation of thoughts. Most people say what they

        One hallmark of human civilisation is the ability to document their

        writing. The advantages of written communication include the 
        following:
        (a) It is learnable and improvable;
        (b) It is permanent and therefore can be preserved from one

        (b) It helps to multiply chances of error. A written material 
        that is made up of errors can result in dare consequences.

        Non-verbal communication has always been a part of human 
        existence as we communicate with every action or inaction that we 
        are involved in. It includes all the messages we use aside words. 
        Some non-verbal communication forms are culture based, while 
        others are gender-based. Kant (2011) explains that only 7% of our 
        messages are through words while 93% are non-verbal, while 55% 
        are based on what people see, another 38% are transmitted by the 
        tone of voice. Most non-verbal communication is more active 
        when it is complementing verbal communication. 
        Some non-verbal channels that authors including Wilson

        a lot of movement of the legs could be a sign of nervousness. It is 
        grouped as aggressive, attentive or emotional body language. 
        Aggressive body language includes facial signals that show threats, 
        attacks, signals such as clenching of fist as if to strike, and 
        insulting gestures. Attentive gestures include listening, ignoring 
        distraction, stillness, gaze, patience, slow nodding etc.

        Language is any formalised system of communication, that uses 
        sounds or written symbols which the majority of a particular 
        community will readily understand (Chambers 21st Century 
        Dictionary). Language enables people to document their progress, 
        transmit experiences and influence the behaviour of others. When 
        Communication, Language and Culture in Africa 145
        people speak and comprehend a given language, it helps to 
        strengthen understanding and collective goals. 
        Human language, according to Bates and Fratkin (1999) began 
        as a call system, and the amount of messages that can be conveyed 
        is indefinite. People regularly create new messages, by using 
        sentences that have never been spoken. Human language is 
        accessible from birth to death and is dependent on both signals and 
        symbols. Symbols are sounds that have meaning for a group of 
        people. Key to understanding symbols in human communication is 
        cultural specificity.
        Linguistic history according to Fromkin, Rodman and Hyam 
        (2011) reveal that spoken language existed for over tens of 
        thousands of years, while the earliest written records are about six 
        thousand years old. Cultural evidence also shows that human 
        language can be traced to about four million years. Drawing from 
        both historical and cultural dimensions of language, it is 
        appropriate to conclude that language had existed from the 
        beginning of human existence on earth. Many research had been 
        carried out on the origin of human language central to all the 
        findings is the agreement that it originated from a single source, 
        termed monogenetic theory of language (Fromkin et al. 2011).`
          },
          {
            title : "Characteristics of Human Language",
            content : `
        (1) Human language is well developed and arbitrary: Human 
        language is developed that meanings transmitted are 
        comprehensible by the receivers. It is arbitrary as meanings 
        are not fixed but determined by context. According to Bates 
        and Fratkin (1999), the sounds of a language have no fixed 
        meaning as meanings are identifiable through the ways sound 
        are combined into words and words are arranged to make 
        sentences.
        (2) Human language is learned: The ability of human beings to 
        acquire, know and use language is a biologically based ability 
        rooted in the structure of the human brain and expressed in 
        different modalities, spoken or signed (Fromkin et al. 2011) .
        146 Amenaghon Francis
        (3) Human Language is Dynamic: Human language can 
        combine symbols in myriad ways to achieve a variety of 
        meanings, some that have never been used before. New 
        words are invented daily. 
        (4) Language Allows Humans to be Creative: People can talk 
        about the past, present and future as well as discuss abstract 
        issues. For instance, people can have their experience of what 
        happened decades ago. This is observable in the oral literature 
        culture in Africa, through which mores of a society are 
        transmitted from one generation to another. Creativity of 
        human language allows humans to talk about abstract 
        concepts such as hunger, love, desire, etc. People create 
        words or attach new meanings to existing words to fit their 
        immediate need or as a result of scarcity of words to express a 
        new phenomenon. The word “cloning” did not exist until 
        scientists came up with the possibility of producing a set of 
        identical cells or organisms from a single parent cell or 
        organism.
        (5) Language is a Social Tool: People learn languages to be able 
        to interact with others and exchange ideas and desires with 
        their society and with past generations. When we read books 
        written hundreds of years ago, we become conversant of such 
        cultures.
        (6) Language has Rules: Every language has rules that govern 
        its use. English language rules include tenses, verb agreement 
        (concord) etc. Other languages such as Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, 
        Edo languages etc. have rules on their usage. Some make 
        meanings through tone, or stress pattern. Hausa language uses 
        more of stress pattern for meaning, Yoruba uses more of tone 
        for meaning.
        Fromkin, Rodman and Hyams (2011) explain that there are some 
        attributes that are central to human language. 
        (1) Wherever humans exist, language exists. For people to 
        communicate or interact with each other there must be an 
        acceptable or general way to engage themselves in talk. Most 
        times when many languages are used in a given geographical 
        space, the people come up with an acceptable language for all 
        which is referred to as Pidgin or Creole. Chambers 21st Century 
        Dictionary defines pidgin as “a type of simplified language 
        used especially for trading purpose between speakers of 
        different languages, consisting of a combination and often 
        simplification of the vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation 
        systems of the languages concerned”. Examples include 
        Nigerian Pidgin, Ghanaian Pidgin and other variations of 
        Pidgin English in Liberia, Sierra Leone etc.
        (2) All languages are capable of expressing Ideas. No language can 
        be labelled as crude and or unsophisticated. The words 
        available for speaking or writing a particular language can be 
        enhanced with the inclusion of new words.
        (3) All languages allow freedom from stimulus: According to 
        Fromkin et al, a person can choose to keep quiet, while at other 
        times he could choose to speak.
        (4) All languages have slang, epithets, taboo words and 
        euphemism for them. For instance, kick the bucket for “the 
        person has died” in English language. 
        (5) Human language includes discrete sound segments, which 
        according to Fromkin et al. include p, n, or a, which can be 
        defined by a finite set of properties or features. In addition, all 
        human languages have vowel and consonant sounds.
        This finite set of discrete sound or gestures combine to 
        produce words that create an infinite set of possible sentences. 
        Part of proficiency in a language is to understand what sounds 
        (or signs) are in that language and what sounds are not. To use 
        the English language properly you must understand verb forms, 
        148 Amenaghon Francis
        tenses, concord, part of speech and more. The structure of 
        language can be described by studying the following:
        (a) Phonology: The study of speech sounds in general or of 
        those in any particular language. It focuses on how 
        sounds are patterned in human language. Phonology 
        helps users of a particular language to know the 
        combination, organisation and structure of sounds that 
        are permissible in a language. 
        (b) Morphology: The study of the rules governing the 
        formation of words. The attention of morphology is on

        Available data show that there are about 557 languages in Nigeria 
        (Paul 2000). This comprises of 514 living languages, two that are 
        spoken as second languages and eleven that have no known 
        speakers. Language is critical as it helps people understand their 
        cultural background. Nothing is exempted from cultural influences, 
        because, it is a medium through which all of life’s events must 
        flow. Language and culture of any ethnic identity should not be 
        toiled with as it encapsulates the history and norms of a people and 
        are channels for the preservation of a group’s identity.
        Makinde (1988) explains that the idea of culture has diverse 
        definitions across ages. In the Victorian Era, culture was labelled 
        Communication, Language and Culture in Africa 149
        as a curtain that divided classes, religions, political parties and 
        even university faculty. In the twentieth century, an 
        anthropological definition views culture to encapsulate a people’s 
        tradition, customs, religious beliefs, values and social political or 
        economic organisations.
        The custom of a group of people is not usually static, but 
        changes over time through events such as interaction with other 
        cultures, migration, education, technology, including the mass 
        media and increase in knowledge. For instance, some of what we 
        knew as African culture in the past had given way to new cultural 
        expressions.`

        The mass media are institutions that send mass messages, through 
        a medium to a large audience. According to Smith (2008), mass 
        communication is “not the act of impacting information, but the 
        representation of shared beliefs”. The representation of issues, 
        events, ethnic groups as well as political systems in the mass media 
        influences our perception of those entities.
        Mass media perform various functions such as information, 
        education, entertainment, persuasion, mobilisation, and the 
        promotion of cultural values. In terms of cultural promotion, the 
        questions that arise are, Which culture is the mass media 
        promoting and what effect is it having on the good of the society?
        Some mass media owned by Africans to a large extent promote 
        western culture to the detriment of indigenous values. For 
        example, Mexican Soap operas, Indian movies and Hip-hop 
        musicians from USA and Europe feature prominently in the mass 
        media in Africa, even occupying primetime on some Nigerian 
        television stations. Some of the cultural objectives of broadcasting 
        in Nigeria which are in tandem with the fundamental objectives 
        and directive principles of state policy itemised in chapter two of 
        the 1999 Constitution (as amended) include to:
        (a) Provide, through programming, a service essential to the 
        maintenance and enhancement of natural identity and 
        cultural sovereignty; 
        150 Amenaghon Francis
        (b) Serve to safeguard, enrich and strengthen the cultural, 
        political, social and economic fabrics of Nigeria;
        (c) Seek, identify, preserve and promote Nigeria’s diverse 
        cultures;
        (d) Select critically, the positive aspects of foreign cultures for 
        the purpose of enriching the Nigerian culture.
        The mass media are expected to enhance the cultural norms of the 
        society in which they exist and identify values in foreign cultures 
        that are beneficial to the people in their sphere of coverage. They 
        should promote the language, music, fashion, folklore, religion, 
        commerce, morality, dress-code and other cultural representation 
        of the communities in which they exist.`

        African communication system is the totality of our platforms for 
        entertainment, education, agenda setting, information, satire that 
        are traditional to Africans. The inroad that colonisation made into 
        Africa in the nineteenth and twentieth century have played 
        negative roles in the preservation of the peoples’ culture. It was 
        relegated to the background while the cultures of the imperialists 
        were promoted. Although, we cannot say we have not benefitted 
        from their imposition, but the benefits cannot be compared to the 
        damage to our culture. For instance, western education, brought 
        writing which helped to document African tradition, religions, 
        philosophy etc for posterity.
        Akpabio (2003) notes, that African traditional communication 
        in the post-colonial era has experienced some positive resurgence. 
        “Traditional communication is still active, especially in the rural 
        areas and to some extent in the urban areas”. He lists some of the 
        unique attributes of African Communication to include the 
        following:
        (a) It is understood by members of a community: The 
        folklore, dance, dress, music etc of a community are easily 
        appreciated by people from the community.
        (b) It appeals and connects with the peoples’ language, 
        culture, belief, myths, legend and customs: Traditional or 
        indigenous communication of a group is meaningful to 
        Communication, Language and Culture in Africa 151
        them, because it naturally emanates from their cultural 
        expressions.
        (c) Traditional communication uses symbols, values and 
        indigenous institutions which enhance messages’ 
        effectiveness: The people understand the embedded 
        cultural expressions, some that are cultic, trado-religious, 
        business, etc.
        Other advantages of African communication system are that it 
        projects African historical past and is rooted amongst the people, 
        who are capable of engaging it for their development agenda. It is 
        enshrined within the culture of a people mostly within a 
        geographical locale. The oral literature in different African 
        societies in proverbs, poetry, dance drama, dress and more have 
        helped to preserve cultural expressions from one generation to 
        another. African communication relies on indigenous technology 
        and employs values and symbols that the people identify with 
        which include the mores of a people, their history and culture. 
        Others include:
        (i) Value: African communication system in terms of quality 
        is important to Africans because it has extensive value 
        beyond the physical, religious, educational;
        (ii) Reach: It is ubiquitous because it reaches many rural 
        people;
        (iii) Furthermore, language communicates one’s area of origin. 
        The tone, intonation and sound production amongst others 
        could reveal the speakers’ linguistic group or mother 
        tongue.
        Authors including Wilson (1998), Doob (1961) and Akpabio 
        (2003) have developed classes of African Communication systems.

        Instrumental communication in the context of African 
        communication is used to complement music, song, dance as well 
        as drama. Traditional instruments are useful in the conveyance of 
        messages. This includes messages of praise, rebuke, satire, 
        morality, mourning etc. The popular talking drum among the 
        Yoruba speaking people of Nigeria is used to convey messages that 
        some people are able to interpret orally. Nabofa (1994) adds that 
        talking drum and horns are used in Africa to transmit cultic verses 
        and messages.
        Music as demonstrative communication shows that traditional 
        African music is sonorous, laden with messages of morality, 
        honesty, hard-work, respect for adults, criticism, satire, praise, 
        suggestion, mobilisation, persuasion and information. Traditional 
        songs such as the songs from the Benin kingdom are replete with
        philosophical messages on diligence, truthfulness, honour to 
        traditional institutions such as the Oba of Benin, shrines etc. In 
        addition, signals are messages in the form of gestures, light sound 
        among others, that convey information or indicate time for action. 
        Signals are supported by oral or visual messages. For instance, red 
        cloth tied around a tree on a farmland sometimes indicate 
        invocation of some spiritual elements, while snail shell tied on a 
        tree could be a warning of the repercussions that await anyone who 
        tries to steal from the fruits on the tree.
        Iconography relates to the form and representation of the 
        subject matter and symbolism in the figurative arts. Kolanut in 
        most parts of Nigeria is used as a sign of welcome. Peacock feather 
        is used to represent the institution of kingship, while native chalk 
        signifies human fertility, symbol of good-luck and success, 
        celebration of escape from mishap, success, joy and achievement.
        Wilson (1998) adds that young palm fronds indicate the 
        presence of a shrine; warning, restriction or instructions for 
        members of a community, cultic group or strangers. When you 
        visit a new community, it is expedient to ask questions on the 
        various representations of indigenous communication that you 
        encounter. Africans have a strong link with their ancestors, super 
        beings, deities and other supernatural or celestial elements. Thus, 
        the desire to know the future, wade of existing or impending crises. 
        For instance, in African communication system when a young 
        couple want to get married, their family members usually consult 
        the oracle through a babalawo or dibia as the Yoruba or Igbos call 
        them.
        Extra-mundane communication is labelled as Bottom-up when 
        Africans make supplications to their gods or ancestors. Top-down 
        communication in African communication could be in the form of 
        dreams, trance, visions, or direction or instructions from 
        intermediaries of the humano-spiritual liaison. Clarke (1972) lists 
        the sources of top-down communication in the Yoruba land to 
        include Ifa, Sango, Orisa Oko, Esu, Oro, etc.
        154 Amenaghon Francis
        Some communication forms in Africa are carried out with 
        visuals that are based on what people can see. These include dress￾style, colour, hairdo, tattoo, tribal marks etc. An Igala man, from 
        Kogi State in the North Central of Nigeria is easily identified by 
        his tribal marks, so also a Yoruba man, and other tribes. Visual 
        communication includes appearance which helps to communicate 
        ethnic origin, beliefs, rurality or urbanity, idiosyncrasy, religion 
        etc. It also includes—written, carved, painted, excavation, 
        memorised or marked sticks.
        Colour in African communication system is used in ways that 
        are specific to different ethnic, religious or cultic settings. To 
        some, white expresses spirituality, holiness and purity, while black 
        is synonymous with mourning, wickedness and evil among most 
        Nigerian tribes.`

        communication helps in the galvanisation of human culture. There

        cultural representation can be anchored.
        For examples, through poetry, proverbs, dance, music, drama, 
        we can promote our culture. Therefore, it is important that youths,

        miles; Nigeria is roughly twice the size of California and three 
        times the size of the United Kingdom. The country is bordered to 
        the south by the Bights of Benin and Biafra, which are on the Gulf 
        of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. On the west Nigeria is bordered 
        by Benin, on the north by Niger, and on the east by Cameroon. In 
        its extreme northeastern corner, Lake Chad separates Nigeria from 
        the country of Chad. Nigeria stretches roughly 700 miles from 
        west to east and 650 miles from south to north.
        The name of the country, which was derived from a major 
        physical feature, the Niger River, was suggested in 1897 by a 
        British journalist, Flora Shaw, who later got married to Frederick 
        Lugard. The country is made up of many culture groups of which 
        the major ones and the three largest are: the Hausa, Igbo and 
        Yoruba. Due to its proximity to the equator, Nigeria experiences 
        high temperatures throughout the year. Besides, its regional 
        contrasts in temperatures are in the range between the highest and 
        the lowest. Nigeria has six ecologically determined zones, namely; 
        coastal forest, mangrove forest, forest-savannah, Sudan-savannah, 
        Sahel-savannah and upland grass. Presently, it has an estimated 
        population of 196 Million (UNO July 24, 2018) of which the 
        majority are in the rural areas. Agriculture, crude oil and gas

        Before the nineteenth century, two phases are evident in the 
        British relations with the territory that later became known as 
        Nigeria. The first phase has been described as the ‘coastal frontier’ 
        phase (1472-1830). This phase was the period when the coast 
        formed the meeting point of Nigerian and European merchants. 
        This phase lasted from the period of the slave trade until around 
        1830 when the steamship was introduced into Nigerian waters. The 
        second phase was the ‘hinterland frontier’ phase, which coincided 
        with the period of the so-called legitimate commerce when with 
        the aid of the steamship and the use of quinine as an antidote to 
        malaria, the British began a more formal process of taking over or 
        seizing African territories from the indigenous people. Thus, this 
        marked the beginning of the imperial and colonial conquest of the 
        nineteenth century.

        Nigeria became a colonial territory in 1900. Prior to this 
        period, there were three separate independent territories under the 
        British control. One was the Niger Coast Protectorate, which was 
        created in 1891 as the Oil Rivers Protectorate. The second was the 
        Colony of Lagos which was ceded to Britain in 1861, and the third 
        was the territory of the Royal Niger Company.
        However, it is important to emphasise that on the eve of 
        colonisation of Nigerian territories, there were states, kingdoms 
        and empires, highly centralised political systems and large urban 
        capitals. Prominent in the picture were kingdoms and empires such 
        as Benin, Oyo, Ile-Ife, Jukun, Nupe, the Hausa states and, the

        Nigeria’s diversity, no doubt, makes it difficult to attempt a 
        discussion of its people. Nevertheless, a short description of the 
        people of Nigeria would enhance our understanding of the 
        dynamics of the evolution of Nigeria as a political unit. This 
        chapter cannot discuss all the people of Nigeria because according 
        to the 1952/53 census, Nigeria had over 200 distinct nationalities. 
        Otite on the other hand, argued that ethnic group identification in 
        Nigeria is problematic. Three main ethnic groups make up the 
        majority of the population. The Hausa, located in the northern 
        savannah, account for roughly 21 per cent of the population, while 
        the Yoruba, located in the southwestern part of the country, make 
        up 20 percent, and the Igbo of the southeast 17 percent. Other 
        ethnic groups with relatively large populations include pastoral 
        Fulani of the savannah, the Ijo of the Niger delta region, the Kanuri 
        of the Lake Chad region, the Ibibio in and around Calabar in the 
        southeast, and the Nupe and Tiv of the middle belt region. 
        However, the ones discussed represent the major tendencies, and 
        are suggestive of what should form the orientation, of a discussion 
        of the people of Nigeria. Therefore, to be discussed are the: Igbo 
        people, the Edo people, the people of the Delta province, the 
        Yoruba people, the people of the savannah, the people of the upper 
        Benue and Plateau region, the Kanuri, the Fulani people and the 
        Hausa people.

        They are located in the present South-Eastern geo-political zone of

        centralised kingdoms that were characteristic of the Yoruba pre￾colonial social formations. They were indeed, a segmentary people 
        without any form of centralised authorities or complex and 
        elaborate bureaucratic political structures. Thus, pre-colonial Igbo

        The exact date of the founding of Benin Kingdom has been a 
        subject of debate for many years. Historians are yet to agree on the 
        date of the founding of Benin Kingdom. Though the traditions 
        preserved by the monarchy traced the dynasty with a fair degree of 
        conviction to an origin around the 13th century, of all the histories 
        of origin of Benin kingdom, the most popular version was that 
        which associate Benin’s rise to influence with the coming of 
        Oranmiyan, a prince of Ile-Ife. Unlike the Igbo societies, Benin 
        kingdom had evolved a well structured centralised system of 
        administration before colonial period. Politically, the Oba of Benin 
        was at the apex of a ruling hierarchy. There were chiefs who 
        formed the state council and the third level of government 
        consisting of a tribute paying unit. In fact, the Benin monarchy was 
        Culture Dynamics in the Age of Colonialism and the Evolution of Nigeria 163
        probably the strongest in Nigeria’s pre-colonial history, given 
        several rituals that attended it. Kingship tradition followed the 
        principle of primogeniture, that is, the first son inherits the throne.
        The People of the Delta Province
        The People of the Delta province are those that inhabited the 
        coastal creeks and swampy terrain of the Niger Delta area. The 
        area can be divided into two zones—the lower delta, the home of 
        the Ijo, the Itsekiri and the Aboh and the upper delta inhabited by 
        the Isoko, Urhobo and Ukwuani. It also comprised the coastal 
        Ibibio and the Efik of old Calabar who lived in the eastern delta. 
        The origins of the people of the delta province are as diverse as 
        their composition. It was common among the Ijo of Nembe, Elem 
        Calabar and the Bonny states for wealthy people with stronger 
        personalities and followings than their rivals to assume kingly 
        roles. That it was enough to be of noble origin, one must constantly 
        strive to maintain greater heights in order to achieve recognition. 
        Meanwhile, the Itsekiri traditions of origin are traced to the 
        Iginuwa migration from Benin during Oba Olu’s reign. Besides 
        that Itsekiri tradition, there was the influence of Ijo, Urhobo and to 
        some extent Yoruba. There were peoples in the delta province such 
        as the coastal Ibibio, Anang and Efik, among others, whose origins 
        and traditions will not be considered here.`

        Extant literature exists on the history of the Yoruba. They inhabit 
        the south-west geo-political zone of Nigeria. The Yoruba in the 
        west stretch from around the area of Badagry to around Warri and 
        inland until they almost reach the Niger. Also, Yoruba people 
        occupied some parts of present day Kwara and Kogi States. In fact, 
        a considerable number of Yoruba people also inhabit the south￾eastern part of the Republic of Benin (former Dahomey). All these 
        areas referred to, formed what was known as the Yoruba country 
        before the European partition of Africa. In addition, pockets of the 
        Yoruba are found in other parts of Nigeria, in some West African 
        countries and even in the West Indies and South America, but the 
        area defined above is regarded as the traditional homeland of the 
        164 Monsuru Muritala
        Yoruba people. They constitute a homogenous socio-linguistic and 
        cultural group within the western part of Nigeria. There is a 
        convergence of literature suggesting that the Yoruba owe their 
        origin to Ile-Ife. As a matter of fact, all royal lineages of Yoruba 
        towns trace their origins to Oduduwa. Meanwhile, there are two 
        myths of origin of the Yoruba. There is one that traced the origin
        of the Yoruba to Lamurudu, one of the kings of Mecca, whose 
        offspring was Oduduwa, the ancestor of the Yoruba. Also, there is 
        another version that claimed that Oduduwa descended from heaven 
        using a chain with a bit of earth in a small shell and created the 
        earth. Indeed, it is obvious from the different versions that 
        Oduduwa was at the centre of Yoruba origin.
        Politically, the Yoruba had a king at the apex. The king ruled 
        over a town, and through subordinate chiefs rules over the 
        surrounding settlements. In fact, the king had several attributes of a 
        divine ruler. The government and administration of a Yoruba town 
        was democratic in that in-put was allowed through the 
        representatives of the lineages to the quarter chiefs for onward 
        transmission to the king. Thus, it can be said that pre-colonial 
        Yorubaland had evolved a strong political unit.`

        The Fulani from the outset are peripatetic by nature. They had no 
        fixed place of abode. They could be found in Sokoto, Katsina, 
        Kano, Borno, Jos and Bauchi. They originated in the middle 
        Senegal valley. They had been influenced by the pastoral Berbers. 
        Their language is Fulfulde, which belongs to the Niger-Congo 
        family of languages. The leader of the Fulani was referred to as 
        Ardo, whose ascension to the throne was subject to having 
        established a herd and a household (wives and children). Unlike 
        the Fulani, the Hausa could be found in the north-western part of 
        Nigeria. Hausa refers to the language than to the people, and the 
        Hausa speaking people founded many small city states. The 
        Bayajidda legend is the most popular of their traditions of origin. 
        This legend traces the origin of the Hausa people back to 
        Bayajidda, a prince of Baghdad, who married a queen of Daura. 
        166 Monsuru Muritala
        Their descendants were said to have founded the seven true Hausa 
        states (Daura, Kano, Katsina, Zaria, Rano, Gobir and Biram) and 
        Bayajidda’s illegitimate sons were regarded as founders of the 
        seven ‘Banza Bokwoi (Zamfara, Kebbi, Nupe, Gwari, Yauri, 
        Yoruba and Kororofa). It is imperative to note that before the 
        advent of the Jihad of the nineteenth century, paganism was the 
        dominant religion. It was the jihad that revolutionarised the 
        political setup by establishing a theocratic state in the whole of 
        Hausaland.
        In the same vein, the wind of the Jihad also blew across the 
        Kanem Borno empire where the over one thousand year Seifawa 
        Dynasty was brought to an end with the establishment of a 
        centralised political organisation under the leadership of Shehu El￾Kanemi in the 19th century. Thus, this marked the beginning of the 
        adoption of the title of ‘Shehu’ instead of ‘Emir’ for the successive 
        ruler of Borno till date. It is however, important to state that prior 
        to this period, the vast area was predominantly occupied by Kanuri 
        group. The area over which the empire held sway is today divided 
        between the Republic of Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria. 
        Also, its boundaries coincide to a considerate extent with the 
        boundaries of the Chad basin, an area more than 300,000sq. miles. 
        However, it should be remarked that the peoples that inhabited the

        administrative systems prior to colonialism and amalgamation

        Islam, Christianity, slave trade and colonialism. For the purpose of 
        our study, all except the slave trade shall be discussed. However, 
        our understanding of the dynamics of the evolution of Nigeria as a 
        political unit would be incomplete without referring to concepts 
        such as family, authority, state and political culture. This would 
        Culture Dynamics in the Age of Colonialism and the Evolution of Nigeria 167
        enable us to decipher the transformation wrought by the specific 
        events highlighted above in the course of the evolution of Nigeria.
        The most basic unit of the Nigerian society is of course the 
        family, and it is through the family that we all first experience 
        authority. Ajayi argued further that the concept of authority 
        transmitted through family life is fundamental to any political 
        culture as it tends to be embedded within the deepest levels of our 
        psyche and that changing concepts of authority tends to be a
        reflection of changes in the family structure. Besides, he submitted 
        that within the varieties and patterns of family in different Nigerian 
        cultures and the changes over time, there have survived a number 
        of common features which still influence our concept of authority 
        within the political culture. Political culture, however, consisted of 
        more than a reflection of attitudes bred within the family. Various 
        historical factors making for social differentiation and the 
        hierarchical structuring of the communities also exerted strong 
        influences on its evolution. It is within this context that this chapter 
        examines the changes in these historical factors, especially external 
        influences in the evolution of Nigeria as a political unit.`

        The introduction of Islam into Northern Nigeria served as a source 
        of power and influence which the existing rulers and other political 
        elite tried to monopolise to strengthen their position above that of 
        their rivals. Initially, Islam introduced writing and provided the 
        literate scribes who were found useful at the courts. Besides, it 
        introduced new principles of administration without at first 
        revolutionising the traditional concept of rulership or existing 
        hierarchical structure of society. By the late eighteenth century, 
        however, Uthman Dan Fodio had emerged a well respected 
        preacher, who criticised the un-islamic religious practices and 
        government of the Hausa rulers. This made him to clash with the 
        Habe rulers more so that in 1804, he had to flee from Degel to 
        Gudu; and, with the support of his followers, declared the Jihad 
        which ultimately covered the whole of Hausaland. Thus, it was a 
        political revolution because power shifted from the traditional 
        Hausa political elite to new elite, Fulani for the most part. A 
        theocratic kingdom was established in which the ruler from the 
        168 Monsuru Muritala
        representative of the ancestors became the vice-regent of God, 
        subject to religious laws within a theocratic kingdom. 
        The implication of this for the evolution of Nigeria is that the 
        Fulani in their bid to govern the Hausa elite intermarried with 
        them, became Hausa speaking, as well as picked essential aspects 
        of Hausa political culture to provide continuity with the past. The 
        allegiance created by this revolution later served as the foundation 
        for the introduction of indirect rule system of administration by the 
        British colonial authorities as well as paved the way for the 
        establishment of Nigeria as a geo-political entity. This was because 
        Islamic religion had engendered the feeling of oneness among 
        those that had come to accept Islam irrespective of geography and 
        location.`

        The origins of Christianity in Nigeria can be traced to the early 
        sixteenth century when Portuguese missionaries gained a 
        precarious foothold in the kingdom of Benin and Warri. Though 
        these early efforts at propagating Christianity in Nigeria did not 
        record any remarkable or lasting success beyond the king’s court, 
        it was not until Europe itself witnessed the evangelical revival of 
        the late eighteenth century; owing largely to the work of men like 
        John Wesley, those Christian missions renewed their interest in the 
        evangelisation of Africa. It is important to stress that the 
        missionary onslaught had a three-pronged mission expressed in the 
        three C’s: Christianization, Commerce and Civilisation. That is to 
        say, that the missionary engaged in evangelism alongside socio￾economic activities. This study, however, is more interested in the 
        nexus between Christianity and the evolution of Nigeria as a 
        political unit. The impact of Christianity on Nigerian life and 
        culture could be said to be most profound in the field of formal and 
        informal education. This was reflected in the operation of formal 
        educational institutions, the promotion of adult education, 
        vocational training, translation of the Bible into various languages 
        and literary studies in the indigenous culture. In fact, Christian 
        missions pioneered the establishment of primary and secondary 
        schools in Nigeria.
        The implication of this educational development is in its direct 
        contribution to political development in Nigeria. Christian mission 
        schools supplied the first crop of nationalist leaders. All those who 
        championed cultural nationalism in the late nineteenth century and 
        anti-colonial protests in the early twentieth century were products 
        of such schools. By the time Governor Clifford introduced elective 
        principle in 1922, the elected members who won elections on the 
        platform of the Nigerian National Democratic Party (NNDP) were 
        educated Christians. In fact, all elected members of the legislative 
        Council from 1923 to 1946 were “professed Christians including 
        many ministers of religion and journalists who fanned the 
        members of national awakening in the country” (Ayandele 
        1966:342). Thus, it can indeed be said that the impact of 
        christianity in the evolution of Nigeria is remarkable.`

        In the late nineteenth century, rivalry in trade, expansionist bid in 
        Africa, balance of power in Europe among other factors 
        culminated in the Berlin conference of 1884/1885 where the 
        Europeans present determined and defined the relationships of 
        African people with the Europeans as stipulated in Articles 34 and 
        35 of the Berlin conference Act respectively. Thus, the imperialist 
        mission for balkanizing and dominating Africa was signed and 
        sealed. The strategies of occupation revolved around violence, 
        manipulation and coercion. In the case of Nigeria, the British did 
        not colonise the territories that made up the polity at once; rather 
        the conquest and absorption were done piecemeal. While some 
        parts like Lagos and Epe were annexed by the British in 1861 and 
        1863 respectively, other areas such as Ijebuland and Benin did not 
        experience colonialism until 1892 and 1897 respectively. Yet, 
        areas such as Abeokuta, Tivland and eastern Nigeria were not

        By the beginning of the twentieth century, the colonial 
        administration in Nigeria had resolved to bring together the 
        administrative units they had developed and control them centrally. 
        There was also the policy of pooling the economic resources of the 
        various units so as to use them more efficiently and effectively. 
        A major step in this direction was the merging in 1906 of the 
        Lagos Colony and Protectorate with the Protectorate of Southern 
        Nigeria by Sir Walter Egerton to constitute the new colony and 
        protectorate of Southern Nigeria. Until 1914, the territory that 
        became Nigeria existed separately as the protectorates of Northern 
        Nigeria and Southern Nigeria. Thus, amalgamation of Southern 
        and Northern Protectorates in 1914 represented a milestone in the 
        evolution of Nigeria as a political unit. 
        For the first time, the disparate nationalities that made up 
        Nigeria were brought together under one umbrella. Several factors 
        were responsible for the need to amalgamate the different regions. 
        It was expected that each part would be able to offer the other the 
        share in its own peculiar advantages. The political experience of 
        the north was put to the service of the south, while the north 
        benefited from the fusion with its prosperous neighbours. This is 
        because the protectorate of Northern Nigeria was so impoverished 
        that it had to be run with a subsidy by the government of the 
        Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. Southern Nigeria had 
        also prospered significantly from its agricultural resources and 
        from the revenue derived from customs, in direct contrast with the 
        north where revenue was raised almost entirely by direct taxation. 
        Apart from the fact that the amalgamation created the geo-political 
        entity called Nigeria, it also further entrenched the western 
        economic forces which according to James Coleman, profoundly 
        changed both the structure of traditional Nigerian Societies and the 
        perspectives of Nigerian peoples. In fact, the tempo and character 
        of the changes created situations and attitudes that have 
        predisposed many Nigerians to racial consciousness and nationalist 
        activities. The amalgamation came under criticism from the 
        educated elite and the elders in the country. In fact, the argument is 
        that the nature of the geographical delimitation imposed on Nigeria 
        by amalgamation successfully evolved a lopsidedness that was to 
        Culture Dynamics in the Age of Colonialism and the Evolution of Nigeria 171
        later put the nation to grief. This has been recognised by two of 
        Nigeria’s nationalist leaders whose views have bred fundamental 
        disagreements over the meaning and depth of the Nigerian state. 
        According to Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, who later became 
        Nigeria’s first Prime Minister:
        …since the amalgamation of Southern and Northern 
        Provinces in 1914, Nigeria has existed as one country 
        only on paper, it is still far from being united. Nigerian 
        unity is only a British intention for the country. 
        Chief Obafemi Awolowo, a foremost nationalist also expressed his 
        own misgivings:
        Nigeria is not a nation. It is a mere geographical 
        expression. There are no “Nigerians” in the same sense 
        as there are “English” or “Welsh” or “French” – the 
        word Nigeria is merely a distinctive appellation to 
        distinguish those who live within the boundaries of 
        Nigeria from those who do not.
        The above views by Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and Chief 
        Obafemi Awolowo confirm the assertion that the seed of disunity 
        had been sowed right from the creation of the Nigerian state by the 
        British colonialists.`

        It is worthy of note that colonial government set out how to rule 
        Nigeria through defined rules and regulations. Thus, they 
        introduced constitutions from time to time. Constitution simply 
        defined is a document which clearly defines how a state should be 
        governed. It contains statements that depicts the relationship 
        between the rulers and the ruled and the basic rights and duties of 
        citizens in a country. Constitutional government is traceable to the 
        institution of the Nigerian Council by Lord Lugard after the 
        amalgamation of the southern and northern protectorates in 1914. 
        The evolution of the Nigerian council marked the beginning of 
        constitutional development in Nigeria.
        172 Monsuru Muritala
        The council was however, dissolved in 1922 following the 
        adoption of the Clifford constitution. Between 1922 and 1954, four 
        different notable constitutions were operated in Nigeria. These are 
        Clifford constitution (1922), the Richard constitution (1946), the 
        Macpherson constitution (1951), and the Lyttleton constitution 
        (1954). All these constitutions are synonymous with unique 
        features.
        The Clifford constitution was synonymous with the 
        introduction of elective principle; which enabled Nigerians to elect 
        representatives which later culminated in the birth of political 
        parties. The Richard constitution gave birth to the idea of 
        regionalism, which enabled different regions: East, West and North 
        to develop at their own pace. The 1951 Macpherson constitution 
        introduced a quasi-federal model into administration of the 
        regions. This allowed for power to be shared between the central 
        and the regional governments but the central government was 
        empowered to have control over the regional government in some 
        matters.
        The Lyttleton constitution of 1954 introduced a federal system 
        of government. It also marked the beginning of the operation of 
        federal system in Nigeria. Also, in 1957 and 1958 constitutional 
        conferences were held for the purpose of resolving some issues 
        such as the minority problem and charting the way forward for the 
        granting of self-government in 1960. Between 1960 and 1979, 
        three constitutions were put in place in the country. These are the 
        1960 independence constitution, the 1963 Republican constitution 
        and the 1979 Presidential Constitution. Presently, the 1999 
        constitution is an improvement of the 1979 constitution.`

          `The place of men and women in African societies is as varied as 
        the peoples and cultures of the continent. Africa is constitutive of 
        over two thousand peoples and cultures. This diversity is reflected 
        in the peoples’ expectations of how men and women ought to 
        behave. As culture is dynamic, so also are cultural expectations of 
        how men and women ought to behave in society. In post-colonial 
        Africa, women have remained a marginalised group. For an 
        accurate understanding of the place of men and women in 
        postcolonial African society, there is the need to take into account 
        the historical trajectory of the continent, and how this has shaped 
        and continues to shape the peoples’ cultures, including gender 
        expectations. Against this understanding, this chapter focuses on 
        gendered realities of the peoples of the continent, and how these 
        have altered and continue to alter as a result of colonisation, 
        missionalisation and globalisation. 
        Gender studies, as an aspect of scholarship has gained attention 
        in the past few decades. It is, in fact, an offshoot of women studies 
        of the 1970s. This period was marked not only by statements from 
        government representatives and feminist activists about the 
        importance of women in every sector of the society but also by 
        determined efforts on the part of advocacy groups to achieve 
        improvement in women’s education, economic condition, political 
        participation and, consequently, social status. Increasingly, 
        discussions by and about women played important role in the 
        political debates of the era. What informed this move was that first, 
        research findings indicated women’s invisibility in the events that 
        made history, and second, official records suggested that women’s 
        voices were systematically left out. This situation implies that the 
        story of the development of human society has been told largely 
        176 Chinyere Ukpokolo
        through male perspectives. In Africa, the situation has led to such 
        questions as: Were women inactive in the events that made history 
        prior to the European occupation of African continent? Were 
        women a subjugated group, chattels of their husbands, who lacked 
        participation in decision-making in their various societies prior to 
        colonial contact as claimed in literature on Africa written by 
        Western scholars? (See for example, Ottenberg 1962; Basden 1938 
        among others). What informed the invisibility of women in 
        historical constructions or the marginalisation of women’s roles in 
        history? These are some of the basic questions that the studies tried 
        to tackle and in the process projected women’s perspective. The 
        reason for women’s exclusion has been put at the foot of 
        colonialism with its Victorian male ideology, which subjugated 
        women.
        Despite the achievements of women’s studies of the 1970s, 
        scholars are of the opinion that for a better understanding of gender 
        relations, study of men and women needs be carried out rather than 
        ‘men’ or ‘women’. This led to gender studies. Gender scholarship 
        as a field of study gained attention in the 1980s in the field of 
        Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology, Philosophy and the natural 
        sciences. This period witnessed the focus of interest, no longer on 
        women alone but gender, that is, men and women. In the study of 
        gender relations, it is brought to limelight the question of the 
        differences between men and women and how these differences 
        transform into access to resources, knowledge and power between 
        the sexes. It is in this respect that the focus of this chapter is on 
        gender, which includes women and men in the context of African 
        cultures and societies. Examples have been drawn largely from the 
        Yoruba, Asante, Kikuyu and Igbo societies.

            title : "‘Gender’ and ‘Sex’",
            content : `
        ‘Gender’ has a different meaning from the word ‘sex’, which is 
        restricted to the biological identity as female or male. Sex, 
        according to Greenglass (1982), is a person’s biological status of 
        male, female, or ambiguous (hermaphrodite). Certain behavioural 
        phenomena follow from a person’s biological status as a female or 
        male. For example, menstruation, lactation and gestation are sex￾related female biological functions. Spermatogenesis and 
        ejaculation are sex-specific male functions. Put differently, gender 
        refers to the socio-cultural and psychological patterning of the 
        differences between male and female. Gender is a social construct 
        that apportions roles to individuals based on sex differentiation. 
        Gender, therefore, stands for the non-physiological aspects of 
        being female or male (Lips 1993). Similarly, Moser (1993) 
        submits: “Gender has since been explained by feminist scholars as 
        a role, a social category, as a practice, as a performance, as social 
        construct, and sometimes as a combination of these” (Moser 1993: 
        433). West and Zimmerman (1991) conclude that gender is a 
        ‘doing’ thing. Thus, gender is a culturally determined aspect of 
        being male or female. It has come to be seen as socially construed 
        structures that determine the appropriateness of actions in the 
        relationships between males and females in society. It maps out 
        restrictions, expectations, ethics and so on within which males and 
        females are expected to operate, thereby creating gender roles for 
        males and females. Bem (1987) in her work on ‘Gender Schema 
        Theory’ discusses the influence of culture on the lens through 
        which an individual perceives reality and, that which makes a child 
        sex-typed. Thus, a highly enculturated individual perceives reality 
        differently from less enculturated one. Obviously, while gender is 
        culturally constructed, sex is a person’s physiological aspect. It is 
        also different from sexuality, which is one’s sexual orientation, 
        preferences, and behaviour.
        The focus in gender studies is on the relations between men 
        and women as they are expressed in terms of power, resources, 
        ideology and so on. As Imam (1990) has rightly noted, focusing on 
        women alone, (which is the feminist strategy), “is no more as 
        accurate representation of social and economic phenomena than 
        focusing on men alone” (Imam 1990: 245). In other words, if we 
        keep on focusing our research on women alone we tend to fall into 
        the mistakes of the earlier writers of African historiography where 
        only men’s point of view have been represented. Consequently, 
        there is the need to study men and women for a better, clearer and 
        overall picture of socio-political and economic realities. Gender 
        issue has been seen as a political struggle over power and 
        178 Chinyere Ukpokolo
        resources just as in class and anti-imperialist analysis. A social 
        science which does not acknowledge gender as an analytic 
        category, Imam further affirms, is an impoverished and distorted 
        science, and cannot accurately explain social realities and hence 
        cannot provide a way out of the present crisis in Africa (Imam 
        1990). Gender relations are structured by ideologies and beliefs, 
        practices, etc., which influence access to resources, rights and 
        privileges and so on. In the quest for the socio-political 
        development of African continent, gender mainstreaming is of 
        great importance.`

            title : "‘Gender Roles’ and ‘Sex (Biological) Roles’",
            content : `
        Gender role refers to “the set of behaviours socially defined as 
        appropriate for one’s sex” (Lips 1993: 49). Put differently, gender 
        roles are those behaviours a culture or society defines as 
        appropriate to one’s sex identity. These culturally defined 
        behaviours affect the choice of carrier, access to resources and so 
        on. A person’s gender-role, Greenglass (1982) further affirms, is a 
        significant social fact. Its importance lies, among other things, on 
        the fact that it has predictable consequences, not only for the 
        individual, but also for the individual’s relationship with others. 
        This is because it is predicted on the expectations held about the 
        characteristics, attitudes and likely behaviour of both men and 
        women. In some cultures, masculine roles may include the repair 
        of leaking roof, fishing, hunting, climbing of palm trees, etc., while 
        feminine roles include cooking, childcare, house care, etc.
        Sex roles are functions or roles, which a male or female 
        assumes because of basic physiological or anatomical differences 
        between the sexes. These roles are exclusive to one of the sexes. 
        For example female sex roles are child bearing, lactation and 
        gestation, while male sex roles include ovum fertilisation and the 
        production of spermatozoa, which determine the sex of a child. 
        Because these roles are biologically determined they are not 
        exchangeable. Gender roles are exchangeable. Sex roles are the 
        same in all societies, and at all periods. Gender roles change with 
        time, class or experience. Gender roles are so tightly woven into 
        the fabric of the society that no individual’s development is free 
        from their influence. Human, as a social being, is influenced by the 
        physical and cultural environments in which s/he is socialising. It 
        is the culture that ultimately molds and forms the individual. This 
        is because, as Sandra Bem has pointed out, culture is the lens 
        through which an individual perceives reality. This is achieved 
        through socialisation, which is a major process in the acquisition of 
        gender roles. Gender roles vary from culture to culture. In other 
        words, a cross-cultural study of men and women shows marked 
        differences in the specific roles, behaviour and personality 
        characteristics ascribed to men and women.`

            title : "Gender Stereotypes",

        Gender stereotypes constitute of a variety of expectations about 
        how an individual will look, act, think, and feel as a result of his or 
        her sex identity. There are certain stereotypes associated with 
        males and females, and these are dynamic, depend on social and 
        cultural contexts, and thus vary across time and space; they are 
        continually being reworked and their boundaries renegotiated. 
        Although these boundaries are moveable in theory, nevertheless, 
        transgressing them often invokes negative reactions from others. In 
        her study of three New Guinea societies, for example, Mead (1935) 
        notes that gender stereotypes vary across cultures and societies. In 
        one of these societies, Arapesh, both males and females were 
        socialised and were expected to be loving, caring, gentle, 
        nurturing, responsive, co-operative, and willing to subordinate 
        themselves to the needs of others. In Mundugumour, or head 
        hunters, men and women were expected to be aggressive. For the 
        Tchambuli, women were socialised to be dominant, unemotional, 
        tend to be in-charge while men were usually less responsible and 
        more emotionally inclined. These demonstrate that gender roles are 
        culturally determined, so also are gender stereotypes.`

        Women, on the other hand, are assumed to be the opposite. 
        Women tend to be described as dependent, subjective, passive, 
        feminine, appreciative, attractive, charming, dreamy, emotional, 
        excitable, mild, sensitive, sentimental, submissive, talkative, weak, 
        frivolous, flirtatious, fickle, nagging, nurturing and friendly. They 
        are equally assumed as not being competitive, not adventurous, not 
        assertive, and lacking self-confidence. Stereotypes are not given

        in the kitchen. This trains the girl-child to see cooking as women’s 
        role. Also, the type of toys bought for each sex emphasises the 
        expected gender roles. For instance, a boy is given balls, toy cars, 
        etc., implying outdoor activities, while the girl is given dolls, teddy 
        bear, (for cuddling to show the nurturing role), spoon, cooking

        Another important agent of socialisation is the school. Teachers

        to cultural expectations. Through counselling, students are 
        Gender and African Cultures 181
        encouraged on the choice of careers to make. For instance, a girl 
        may be advised to register for ‘Food and Nutrition’ as subject 
        because the knowledge acquired will help her in carrying out her 
        role as a wife in future. A boy may be advised to pick up Visual 
        Arts, Physics, or Technical Drawing. In these choices, different 
        gender roles are emphasised for the sexes.
        Peer Group
        Peer group helps in gender role acquisition as children learn from 
        one another. As children play together and interact they learn from 
        one another. Part of what they learn is gender role expectation. 
        Boys are encouraged to play with boys while girls play with girls.
        Religious Institutions
        Both Christian and Islamic religions have certain codes that guide 
        the behaviour of men and women. In some churches men and 
        women are not expected to sit at the same side in the church hall. 
        Women and girls have their separate sections where they sit. This 
        emphasises the differences between the sexes. Similarly, Islamic 
        religion has certain tenets that guide men and women’s behaviour, 
        for instance, where to sit in the mosques, who will lead prayers, 
        dressing, and so on. Religious institutions also have prescriptions 
        on how to organise the family, and the roles of father and mother, 
        boys and girls in the family.`

        the land following a crime of sexual immorality should be seen as 
        a form of sacrifice, on the part of women. Although she was forced 
        to die, she is today worshipped. This demonstrates the integration 
        of women in religious sphere. Another example is Queen Moremi 
        of Ile-Ife, who offered herself to be captured by invading Igbo 
        warriors and through this she was able to liberate her people 
        (Fatokun 2010:136-138). Apart from cult related activities, women 
        participated actively in community affairs. This is why in every 
        Yoruba community there are female chiefs who are deeply 
        involved in indigenous governance.
        Among the Yoruba people also, motherhood is a cherished 
        status, as in other African societies. The significance of this 
        institution lies in the fact that children are seen as blessing in 
        Africa, a connection between the living, the dead and the unborn; 
        and symbolic of the society’s capacity for regeneration. This is 
        reflected in names children are given at birth and the sayings 
        common amongst the peoples. Among the Igbo, for instance, 
        ‘Nneka’ means ‘Mother is supreme’ while ‘Nneamaka’ is 
        interpreted as ‘Mother is good’. The Yoruba maxim ‘Iya ni wura’
        means ‘Mother is gold’ while the father is metaphorically referred 
        to as ‘Mirror’. Also the Tiv of the middle belt, Nigeria have names 
        like Ngodo meaning ‘Mother is good’, and Ngohemba, which 
        means ‘Mother is great’. In training a child, greater responsibility 
        is placed on the woman as she is also seen as the custodian of the 
        values of the people. 
        The position of women in precolonial African societies can 
        further be elucidated by looking at other roles that women played 
        in their societies. Among the Kikuyu people of Kenya, a Bantu 
        speaking people of east Africa, Patricia Stamp reported that the 
        society practiced dual sex organisation. Women were engaged in 
        economic activities, battering the goods they produced such as 
        pottery, honey and beer. They travelled to neighbouring pastoral 
        areas battering their goods. Women had their power bases but 
        excluded from men’s meetings where decision affecting the life of 
        all and sundry were taken. However, women had their age grades, 
        which offered them opportunity for decision making. Two of these 
        are the Nyakinyua, which comprises of women whose first child 
        has been circumcised, and Kang’ei, women with uncircumcised 
        children. Women had control over their economic resources. 
        European incursion into the society, however, have detrimental 
        effects on women’s power bases as these were not recognised, and 
        ultimately replaced with Western structures that undermined 
        women’s position. Among the Igbo people of west of River Niger, 
        dual-sex political system also existed. The omu was regarded as 
        the mother of the community while the obi was the leader and 
        father of the community. For the Igbo east of the River Niger, the 
        umuada or umu okpu played crucial roles in the affairs of their 
        community, both in decision making and in peace making. As 
        Ukpokolo (2012) noted, the Igbo associational life is highly 
        gendered as men and women have their assemblies. However, 
        resolutions arrived at in women’s meetings are binding on women 
        alone, while those of the men are binding on all members of the 
        society. Women, however, have the rights of consultation which 
        must not be violated as they also reserve the right to contest any 
        resolution that did not promote common good. Women were also 
        actively involved in the economic sector through trading, including 
        long distance trading (see Ukpokolo 2016a), and had power over 
        their resources. Colonialism and the subsequent culture change that 
        accompanied the encounter have brought about drastic change on 
        women’s former power bases. 
        In Yoruba land, women were actively involved in economic 
        activities, trading on craft goods and providing services such as 
        hair dressing and cloth making. Women were also mostly 
        responsible for the processing of agricultural produce and their 
        subsequent sales in the markets. Participation in economic 
        activities imbued women with a high sense of gender solidarity 
        184 Chinyere Ukpokolo
        based on mutual interests. They formed ‘egbe’ (trade association). 
        In the pre-colonial era, Yoruba women dominated the distribution 
        and service sector. Through economic power women were able to 
        rise to positions of political authority. Sanday (1979: 177) noted 
        that the fact that economic power preceded political authority is 
        not surprising, and that power over strategic resources has been 
        frequently noted to be antecedent to or at least correlated to the 
        development of economic and political authority. People like 
        Iyalode Efunsetan was one of such women who, through economic 
        power, gained political importance (see Awe 1992). As Ukpokolo 
        (2016b) noted, in the religious sphere, women in precolonial 
        Yoruba society played significant roles as priestesses, and till 
        today some deities are female in Yorubaland. Similarly, women 
        could also be Ifa priests. The Yoruba cosmology therefore 
        recognises that men and women are complementary and therefore 
        none is superior to the other. In the political sphere, women could 
        be oba as recorded in Ondo and Oyo in precolonial Yoruba. 
        In precolonial Ghana, the Queen mother, referred to 
        Asantehemmaa, played crucial role in the political system of the 
        Akan peoples. The Akan is a cultural group in Ghana located in the 
        Ashanti region of the southern Ghana and Ivory Coast. The queen 
        mother had her own stool, which symbolised power and authority. 
        Stoeltje (2003) noted that unlike in some African societies where 
        women leaders derived their power through their relationship, the 
        queen mother in Akan land derived hers by her qualification. She 
        noted that among the Akan people, “both the queen mother and a 
        chief must be members of the same royal family…In some 
        instances, the queen mother may, in fact, be the biological mother 
        of the chief…but more often they are aunt and nephew or uncle 
        and niece, or, frequently they are cousins” (Stoeltje 2003: 4). The 
        colonial forces ignored the queen mother and other female leaders 
        in Akan, ignoring their relevance and concentrating on men leaders 
        and not giving the Asantehemmaa any official recognition. Despite 
        these rights enjoyed by women in the pre-colonial period, they did 
        not make women equal partners with men. In the new state 
        structures brought about by colonialism, women’s representation in 
        government bodies was limited compared to the number of men as 
        Gender and African Cultures 185
        a result of their privileged opportunity in wealth accumulation and 
        access to Western education. Citing Reh and Ludwar-Ene (1995), 
        the author noted that in traditional African society, “women in 
        matrilineal and matrilocal societies enjoy a degree of stability in 
        their life because they do not have to give up their status and/or 
        identity and begin anew in a strange environment when they 
        marry” (Stoeltje 2003: 8). Thus, the advent of colonialism in 
        Africa brought about changes in African societies—political, 
        economic, religious spaces and so on. All these brought about new 
        sets of values, norms, and a wide range of social and cultural 
        institutions that have continued to shape African experiences. 
        Identifying the Source of Women’s Marginal Positioning in 
        Society: Feminism and African Realities
        The concept ‘feminism’ has no universally acceptable definition. 
        What exist are definitions based on different perspectives authors 
        view the concept. The important thing, however, is that all the 
        definitions have a common goal. What is intended here therefore is 
        a basic explanation of what most of these definitions intend to 
        achieve. Feminism is an advocacy of women’s rights based on the 
        belief in the equality of the sexes. As an advocacy for women 
        liberation, it seeks for equality with men in terms of opportunities, 
        actualisation of women’s rights and rejects discrimination meted 
        against women based on sex difference. It is, therefore, founded on 
        a rejection of unequal distribution of power and resources between 
        men and women in society. Feminism provokes different reactions 
        throughout the world. In Africa, it is dismissed by some people as 
        a Western concept imposed on the world as a new form of Western 
        imperialism. However, the concern of feminism, in most cases, is a 
        call for a new kind of knowledge and attitude in human society; the 
        creation of more space for women, the practice of inclusivity.
        Feminism is logically, then, a set of ideas, which are also a 
        political practice. The fundamental source of disagreement 
        amongst the feminists is the basis of gender oppression or the 
        unequal access to power and resources between men and women. 
        This has given rise to different types of feminism. There are 
        disagreements about the source of the problem and how to address 
        186 Chinyere Ukpokolo
        the problem. For instance, among feminists in the United States, 
        there was a huge debate about whether to promote equality or to 
        promote protective legislation. That class-based debate divided the 
        women’s movement. Those working in the unions and working 
        class women were interested in protective legislation, pointing out 
        that women are different from men and, therefore, needed to be 
        supported in order to cope better in male-dominated organisations, 
        and so on.`

            title : "Types of Feminisms",
            content : `
        There are four main types of feminism. These are Liberal 
        feminism, Radical feminism, Marxist feminism and Socialist 
        feminism. The basic difference between these groups is the source 
        or the origin of women marginalisation in the society. Let us look 
        at each of these more closely.
        Liberal Feminism
        This is the earliest type of feminism. The main focus of liberal 
        feminism is equal rights for women. This is the type adopted by 
        the UN in its programmes on women. The liberal feminists are 
        interested in promoting change within the existing framework of 
        the society. They do not want to change their society – they want 
        women to have more rights within the society as it is. All the world 
        conferences on women have Liberal Feminism as their basis. So, 
        they are interested in laws governing work, for example, equal pay 
        for equal work, equality before the law, etc. In the final analysis, 
        the main concern of liberal feminism is equal rights for the sexes –
        the extension of liberty, equality and justice to women through 
        legal and social reforms. They work within the political system to 
        get better opportunities for women. They are also known as 
        mainstream feminists.`
          },
          {
            title : "Radical Feminism",
            content : `
        This is most closely identified with the women’s liberation 
        movement, which took shape in the late 1960s. According 
        to the radical feminists, women’s oppression is a basic fact of 
        every society and patriarchy is responsible for this situation. 
        Gender and African Cultures 187
        A patriarchal culture may be described as a culture in which male 
        values and privileges have become dominant and societal values 
        are highly influenced by the male point of view. Radical feminists 
        declare that the ‘personal is political’ as a rallying point slogan, 
        and examine the ways human reproduction is controlled, and one is 
        socialised through such institutions as family and religious 
        institutions, and compulsory heterosexuality. They seek to create a 
        new social framework as feminist alternatives in every area of life: 
        family, religion, reproduction, marriage, etc. To them, women’s 
        relationship to men is politically problematic. They brought 
        reproduction into political arena by questioning women’s 
        reproductive role, that is, biological role and insist that it must be 
        by choice. They support lesbianism, gay marriage, abortion and the 
        choice to have children or not. Radical feminism is associated with 
        militancy.`
          },
          {
            title : "Marxist Feminism",
            content : `
        Marxist feminism brought class analysis to feminism. It uses 
        Marxist method of social analysis to produce knowledge of the 
        wider context of women’s oppression through history. They posit 
        that the bourgeois capitalists are the men while the women are the
        proletariats, and the oppressed. This group sees gender inequality 
        as a consequence of capitalism. The lack of economic power on the 
        part of the women and the possession of this power by the men, the 
        radical feminist argue, is fundamental to women subjugation. In 
        other words, capitalism excludes women and is, therefore, the 
        source of women’s marginalisation. They, therefore, argue for the 
        empowerment of women economically.`

          {
            title : "Socialist Feminism",
            content : `
        This type of feminism combines the insights of the Marxist and 
        Radical feminism and insists that gender-based divisions were a set 
        of social relations, which have historically, and in all known 
        societies, been based on male domination and female 
        subordination. They are not distinct from class relations, in 
        capitalist, non-capitalist, centralised and non-centralised societies 
        but are, however, embedded in those social relations of 
        188 Chinyere Ukpokolo
        reproduction such that they, therefore, serve capitalism, feudalism 
        or any other social system. To the socialist feminists, therefore, 
        women marginalisation and subordination is a question of 
        problematic gender relations.`

        Western stereotypical perception of women and associating them 
        with domesticity affected the white administrators’ perception of 
        women in Africa. Secondly, with the importation of capitalism, the 
        female former power bases started to wane. As men took up wage￾paid employment in the cities and male elders appointed as chiefs 
        to assist the European administrators, women’s potentials were left 
        unrecognised (see Okonjo 1976, Uzuegbunam 1988, Van Allen 
        1972). Rather than uplifting the status of women, colonialism 
        undermined women’s former power bases without providing 
        modern forms of autonomy and power in exchange. In 
        Yorubaland, Kikuyu, Akan, Igboland, and in other African 
        societies, the narrative is similar. Women in post-colonial Africa 
        encounter challenges that hinder their effective participation in 
        society. Gender and income disparity has indicated women at a 
        disadvantaged position. In a study carried out on gender pay gap in 
        Ethiopia, Nordman et al. (2010) note that among other issues, 
        women’s monthly wages represented only 55 percent of men’s 
        wages, with large variations across subgroups. Thus, Backiny￾Yetna and Wodon (2010) conclude that “labour income tends to be 
        controlled by men” in the Sub-Saharan Africa (Backiny-Yetna and 
        Wodon 2010: 377). In the academe, women academics face 
        diverse challenges that hinder their participation. In a study on 
        career paths of women academics in a Nigeria university, 
        Ukpokolo (2016c) contends that gender disparity in the academe is 
        reflected in the gendered practices imported into the university, 
        combined with household labour, hinder women’s intellectual 
        productivity and career progression. Coupled with other issues like 
        lack of access to finance or loans and maternal mortality, African 
        women in the post-colonial have become the face of poverty in the 
        region, hence, the ‘feminization’ of poverty. These constitute parts 
        Gender and African Cultures 189
        of the fundamental issues African women emancipation activists 
        are agitating against. It should be noted that women as the second 
        half of the human society need to be taken into account in the quest 
        for solutions to the developmental challenges of the continent. 
        Their emancipation is the emancipation of the society generally. 
        Suffice it to say here that African scholars have rejected 
        Western-oriented feminism as another form of Western 
        imperialism. Western-oriented approaches in addressing women 
        marginality in Africa have not succeeded. It has often been argued 
        that women in most traditional African societies play 
        complementary roles with men rather than the subordination and 
        subjugation of women that are popular in Western literature on 
        Africa. Thus, Oyewumi (1997) notes that the fundamental category 
        ‘woman’ which is foundational in Western gender discourses did 
        not exist in Oyo-Yorubaland prior to Western contact through 
        colonialism and the sustained contact and dominance in the 
        production of knowledge. Nevertheless, it is pertinent to note that, 
        as in all societies, there are also some cultural practices in 
        traditional African society that are detrimental to the survival of 
        the African woman. One of such is widowhood practice, which 
        varies among cultures. Widowhood is associated with many rituals 
        some of which are harmful and devastating to women. Among the 
        Igbo of southeastern Nigeria for example, the ritual starts 
        immediately the woman discovers or is informed of the death of 
        her husband. What follows depends on the peculiarity of each 
        society. In some places, she is expected to shave her hair and must 
        no longer be allowed to see the corpse of her husband from this 
        point. If the woman is suspected of having a hand in the death of 
        the man, she could be made to prove her innocence by going 
        through devastating rituals. Among the Idoma of Benue State, 
        Nigeria, the woman is kept outside the house or in an uncompleted 
        building for a number of days while the mourning period lasts. 
        What obtains in some parts of Esan in Edo State is that the widow 
        sits on a mat, eats with her left hand, which she must not wash for 
        some days. Also, she is not expected to bathe or wash her clothes 
        during this period. Widowhood practice in Africa has become a 
        source of concern to African feminists and gender activists. Yet, it 
        is not common for widowers to undergo such rituals on account of 
        190 Chinyere Ukpokolo
        the death of their spouses. It is gladdening that some of these 
        cultural practices are changing.
        Inheritance practices in many societies in Africa are not 
        women-friendly. Traditionally, the writing of Will is non-existent 
        as the society is characterised by orality. After the burial of the 
        deceased, elders of the extended family meet for the sharing of the 
        property (e.g wives, offices and materials). These elders, in most 
        cultures, are only males. Sharing of offices is male-centered as 
        women cannot be made the head of the family. No matter how 
        young a male child is, in some cultures, he is superior to female 
        children in this regard, no matter how old they may be. However, it 
        is not impossible for female children to inherit property in some 
        cultures, especially when they are single, but this is not always the 
        case for married women because of the belief that they, in their 
        entirety, belong to their husbands. What is operational in 
        traditional Igboland is more hostile to women as they do not have 
        any right to inherit anything from their fathers by tradition (Oke 
        2001:52). If a man dies without having a son, his belongings go to 
        his brother or uncle, and his name is believed to have been lost. 
        For this reason, having a male child is crucial among the Igbo; 
        thus, the relevance of the name ‘Ahamefula’, meaning, ‘Let my 
        name not be lost’. It is important to note that while a woman may 
        not inherit property, she could be inherited. Traditionally, wives of 
        the deceased were part of his property. In such a situation, she 
        could be inherited by somebody too old for her or somebody who 
        may be younger than her own son. However, it is not in all cases 
        that such a woman is expected to have sexual relationship with the 
        man that inherited her. In most cases in Igbo land, she and her 
        children simply come under the protective hands of such a man.
        Another issue that needs to be pointed out is that certain 
        challenges women encounter in society are intra-gender based. 
        Experience has shown that in some cases women contribute to the 
        oppression of their fellow women. According to Atere (2001), the 
        roles some women play are obstacles to the fulfillment of women’s 
        cultural rights in Yorubaland as they are instigators of polygyny 
        and custodians of harmful widowhood rites. Women are often used 
        to perpetuate patriarchal culture, thereby reducing the dignity of 
        fellow women. The mother-in-law may see her daughter-in-law as 
        an intruder, who has come to reap the fruit of her child-bearing, 
        hence perpetual hostility between them (Atere 2001:58). Thus, 
        conflict between wives and mothers-in-law are common in many 
        marriages. There is the need for men and women to change 
        negative attitudes learnt through socialisation in order to harness 
        the potentials in both sexes for the development of Africa. Each 
        must be recognised as indispensable entity, and the question of 
        inferiority needs not arise in our interactions. 
        Increasingly, gender activists in many countries are challenging 
        ideologies and practices that work against women. Issues such as 
        sexual violence, domestic violence, and women’s lack of 
        participation in politics as leaders and under-representation in 
        appointive positions are often criticised by such activists. 
        Nevertheless, African women feminist scholars disagree with their 
        Western counterpart on the issues of gay marriage, transgender, 
        homosexuality, among others. Experiences across different regions 
        of Africa indicate that we cannot, simply, import terms and 
        concepts that have been developed elsewhere, under different 
        socio-political conditions and use them unquestionably. Imported 
        ideologies and values more often than not have proved to be 
        detrimental to the African sub-region, especially in the areas 
        relating to women issues. For instance, the idea of ‘woman-as￾housewife’ was imported from Victorian Europe to Africa. This 
        has undermined the African realities to the detriment of women, 
        and the continent at large. In Africa, prior to colonial contact, the 
        division into private and public domains were non-existent as men 
        and women laboured in all areas of production, industries and 
        commerce. Men and women, for instance, were farmers, craft 
        workers such as basket makers, carvers, sculptors and so on. Under 
        the colonial administration, however, women were denied 
        employment in the emerging cash economy, and their productive 
        work in agriculture, trade and industry was sidelined, with the 
        deployment of technology. Men gained employment in the new 
        capitalist and political systems, while women were left out, and 
        eventually their productive activities undervalued. Ever since, 
        women have remained a marginalised group in Africa.
        Relevance of Gender Studies to the Advancement of Humanity
        As a research strategy, gender theory and knowledge within social 
        science research is relevant and necessary on five levels:

        (i) Handrahan notes that the addition of gender as a research 
        strategy within the frameworks of the traditional social 
        science methods enables the researcher to overcome, to 
        some degree, the flaws (shortcomings) of modern 
        social sciences which neglected half the population 
        of humanity. Gender strategy, therefore, renders 
        methodology more solid and theory more adequate in 
        describing the sociological question and, therefore, aids 
        in producing less-flawed social science.
        (ii) The author further observes that gender strategy, by 
        providing an authentic examination of the entire 
        population in question, provides for more valid research 
        findings. This is because men and women are put into 
        account. Therefore, gender research increases the validity 
        and reliability of social science research.
        (iii) Again, Handrahan points out that gender as a research 
        strategy allows for more accurate prescriptive outcome. 
        In other words, gender studies and the outcome ensure 
        that prescriptions could be more accurate and reliable in 
        policy formulation and programmes.
        (iv) In scholarship, Imam (1990) rightly observes that gender 
        knowledge and analysis will enrich immensely the scope 
        and depth of knowledge, and clarify the nature of the 
        social relations in a more accurate manner.
        (v) Ultimately, gender studies create knowledge, which 
        could help to bring about positive socio-political and 
        economic changes, and influence better gender relations 
        and address imbalances.`
